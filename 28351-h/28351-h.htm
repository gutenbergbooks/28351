<p>In the Section of the Code for 1894-5, dealing with Reading
Books, occur the words "Passages impressing on the
children the duty of gentleness and consideration for
others, and that of the humane treatment of animals may
also be widely introduced."</p>

<p>It is in the hope of encouraging that humane treatment
of animals, which in the hands of a sympathetic teacher
may so easily and naturally be made the first step towards
the "gentleness and consideration for others," that this
series has been prepared. It is hoped now that the teaching
of humanity has received official recognition, that those who
have charge of the young will recognize its importance,
and will realise that unless the cultivation of the heart runs
<i>pari passu</i> with that of the head, the spread of education
may become a curse instead of a blessing.</p>

<p>The Editors are much indebted to the R.S.P.C.C. for
permission to reprint "Trusty" and "Out in the Cold."</p>

<h2>DICK AND HIS CAT.</h2>


<h3>1. UP TO LONDON.</h3>

<p>1. In the reign of the famous king
Edward the Third, there was a little boy
named Dick Whitt-ing-ton, whose father
and mother died when he was very young.</p>

<p>2. He knew nothing about them, and he
was left, a poor little ragged, dirty fellow,
to run about the streets of a small country
village.</p>

<p>3. As poor Dick was not old enough to
work, he was in a sad state; he got but
little for his dinner, and often had nothing
at all for his supper. For all the people in
the village were very poor.</p>

<p>4. They could often spare him nothing
more than an old crust of bread, or some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
scraps that even a dog would not have
liked. One day a man who was driving a
waggon came through the village.</p>

<p>5. He had eight fine large horses to
pull it, and, as he walked by their side,
he spoke kindly to them, and never
whipped them. This made Dick think
that he must be a good man.</p>

<p>6. "If he is kind to the horses," said
Dick to himself, "perhaps he will be kind
to a poor lad like me." So Dick went
up to speak to the carter and asked him
to let him walk along by the side of his
waggon.</p>

<p>7. The two began to talk, and the man,
hearing from poor Dick that he had no
parents, and seeing how ragged his clothes
were, took pity on him. He told Dick
that he was going with the waggon to
London town. "And," added the man,
"you may come with me if you like.</p>

<p>8. "I do not think that you can be much
worse off there than you are here; and
perhaps you may be better off in the
great city. You may ride in the waggon
if you please."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>9. Dick was glad enough to do this, and
the good driver took care to share his food
with him on the
way. He took as
much care of the
horses and of Dick
as he did of himself.
Dick got safe
to London.</p>

<span class="caption">SETTING OFF.</span>
</p>

<p>10. Now before
he had seen the streets of London, Dick
had thought that they were made of gold,
for an old man in the village at home had
told him so. But the old man had only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
been in joke. He meant that folks often
became rich there.</p>

<p>11. So Dick ran away from the waggon
in a great hurry, to find the golden pavements.
But he saw nothing except mud
and dirt, and a crowd of people all looking
very busy, who took no heed of him.</p>

<p>12. Instead of being able to pick up
little bits of gold from the streets when he
wanted money, Dick now found that he
could not find even a penny to buy a loaf
for himself, and no one gave him one either.</p>

<p>13. He stayed all night in the streets,
and, next morning, he got up and walked
about, asking those whom he met to give
him something to keep him from starving.</p>

<p>14. Hardly any man or boy whom he
asked gave him a copper. But at last, a
woman, seeing his pale face, drew out two
pence and put them into Dick's thin hand.</p>

<p>15. Being almost too tired and weak to
buy food, Dick laid himself down on the
doorstep of a big house. He almost wished
to die, for he felt so lonely and forlorn in
that great town, where no one had time to
think about a poor little ragged boy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p><i>Write:</i> Dick went to London with a
man. When he was there, he could get no
food. A kind woman gave him two pence.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Questions: 1. In what king's reign did Dick Whittington
live? 2. In what kind of place was he born? 3. Whom did
he meet going through the village? 4. How did Dick know
that the driver was a good man? 5. What did he do when he
first reached London? 6. What did the kind woman give to
Dick?</p></div>


<h3>2. THE STRAY CAT.</h3>

<p>1. As Dick was hiding his face in his
hands and thinking these sad things, he
felt something very soft rubbing gently
against his neck, which was close to the
hard cold stone step, and he heard a
pleasant sound at his ear.</p>

<p>2. It was the purring of a poor little
stray cat, which was trying to make friends
with him. Dick sat up, and stroked puss.
"Why, you are just like me!" said Dick.
"I believe that you have no home and no
friends either, you poor little thing."</p>

<p>3. When the cat heard Dick speak so
kindly to her, she crept into his lap,
looking into his face as if to say, "Are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
you going to let me come, or will you
drive me away, as all the rest of the world
does?"</p>

<p>4. Finding that Dick put one arm round
her she curled herself up, purring loudly,
and seemed to think that she had found a
home with him on the doorstep.</p>

<p>5. "Poor pussy!" said Dick, "how thin
you are, and how rough your coat is!
Come, I will go and get something for us
both to eat." Dick ran along the street
with the cat in his arms.</p>

<p>6. She could not do enough to thank
him for taking care of her. For she had
been hunted through the streets for many
days. The people with whom she had
lived were gone away and left poor puss
behind to starve in an empty house.</p>

<p>7. They went to a shop and bought milk
and bread. It was a fine feast for them
both, and I do not know which of them
liked it best.</p>

<p>8. The rude boys in the street laughed
at Dick for running along with a cat in
his arms. But he was too brave a boy to
care for that. He only hugged his cat the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
tighter, and laughed at them in return.
So they soon left off.</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 370px;">
<img src="images/image004.png" width="370" height="450" alt="BOTH IN NEED." title="BOTH IN NEED." />
<span class="caption">BOTH IN NEED.</span>
</p>

<p>9. That night, Dick had again no place to
sleep in but the doorway of a big house.
He made himself and his cat as snug as
he could, and had just fallen asleep when
he heard a cross voice say, "What are you
doing here, you lazy scamp?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>10. This was a cook, who was just coming
out. And at the same moment her master
came out behind her. He, too, saw Dick,
and said: "Why do you lie there, my
lad? You seem big enough to work. I
fear that you must be idle."</p>

<p>11. "No, indeed, sir," said Dick. "I
would work with all my heart, but I know
no one to give me work, and I think that
I am ill from want of food and a dry, warm
bed."</p>

<p>12. "Poor fellow!" said the rich merchant,
who was master of the house.
"Come here to me. Let us see what
is the matter with you."</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p><i>Write:</i> A poor little stray cat came to
Dick. He spoke kindly to her and went
to buy bread and milk for both. They
liked the food very much.</p>

<blockquote><p>Questions: 1. What did Dick feel as he lay on the doorstep?
2. What did he say to the stray cat? 3. What did he buy
for them both? 4. Who came out of the door as Dick was
sleeping on the step? 5. Who came out after the maid?
6. What did the master of the house say to Dick?</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>


<h3>3. THE CROSS COOK.</h3>

<p>1. As Dick came up to the merchant,
his knees trembled under him, and he
looked very ill and weak. He had put
the little cat under his jacket, so that the
merchant did not notice her.</p>

<p>2. "You seem half starved," said the
merchant. And he told the cook to give
Dick a good meal at once, make him up
a bed in the garret, and let him stay
with them.</p>

<p>3. He might do what dirty work in the
kitchen he could for the cook. Little Dick
would have been very happy now, but
for the cross cook, who was finding fault
and scolding all the day long.</p>

<p>4. She would rush at poor Dick with
her broom, and hit him hard on the head.
And what was worse, she chased his poor
little cat right out of the house, and said
she would have no cats there.</p>

<p>5. Dick found his pussy again, and took
her up into his own bare and empty garret,
where she was safe, for the cook never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
went there. And pussy was his only friend
at that time.</p>

<p>6. Dick was careful to carry food to his
cat, of which there was always plenty to
be had in that house. But things became
worse and worse in the kitchen.</p>

<p>7. The temper of the cross cook was
tried more and more by the little mice,
which ran over all her nice pies and
puddings, and spoilt them as fast as she
made them.</p>

<p>8. She flew into a passion with Dick
twenty times a day, but it was of no use
to do this. She set traps for the mice, but
they soon found out the trick, and would
not go near them.</p>

<p>9. The cunning little things laughed at
cook and her clumsy traps, and made
merry all night long over the floor of her
room, running races, and keeping her
awake.</p>

<p>10. So she grew crosser and crosser, till
at last Dick felt as if he could not stand it
much longer. But his master was always
kind, and he thought that he would never
leave him if he could help it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>11. He thought that things might mend
and he tried to be patient. And his
cat was always ready with a loving greeting
for Dick when he came to his room.</p>

<p>12. At last one day Dick's master called
all his servants upstairs into his room. He
said that a ship of his was going to sail
for a foreign land in a few days.</p>

<p>13. He asked them if any of them
would like to send some things out in the
ship to be sold. In those days much
money was to be made by selling English
goods in other lands.</p>

<p>14. All said that they would like to
send something. But poor little Dick said
not a word. He had nothing in the world
but the clothes he had on, and his cat.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p><i>Write:</i> Dick was told that he might do
work for the cook. But she was very
cross to him and to his cat. He kept puss
in his own room and took care to feed her.</p>

<blockquote><p>Questions: 1. What did the merchant say about Dick?
2. What did the cook say about the cat? 3. Where did Dick
keep her? 4. What was he careful to carry up for his cat?
5. What did the merchant ask his servants? 6. Why did Dick
say nothing when all the rest spoke?</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>


<h3>4. WHAT THE BELLS SAID.</h3>

<p>1. Now the merchant had a little
daughter, called Alice. And she was a
kind little girl. She looked at the sad
face of poor Dick, and she said in a whisper
to her father, "Why does not that little
boy speak like the rest?"</p>

<p>2. "You had better ask him," said the
father, giving his little girl a kiss before
he went out of the room.</p>

<p>3. So Alice went up to Dick and asked
him why he had not sent some small thing
that could be sold for much money in the
foreign land, though it cost only a little
here.</p>

<p>4. "All the rest are going to send,"
said little Alice, "and when the ship
comes back they will get the money.
Why do you not send something in the
ship too?"</p>

<p>5. "I have nothing to send," said poor
Dick, looking very sad. "I am a poor
boy. The cook is unkind to me, and I
have nothing of my own but a cat."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>6. "I have got some money in my
purse, I will give it to you," said little
Alice. But Dick said that he should not
like to take money from the little girl.</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 276px;">
<img src="images/image005.png" width="276" height="450" alt="ALL DICK HAD." title="ALL DICK HAD." />
<span class="caption">ALL DICK HAD.</span>
</p>

<p>7. Just then the merchant came back into
the room. He had heard what Dick said
about having nothing but a cat.</p>

<p>8. "Fetch your cat, boy, and let her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
go," said he. "I heard the captain of the
ship say that he wanted a cat to clear the
ship of mice. He will give you money for
her."</p>

<p>9. "Oh no, sir," cried Dick, "I could
not give up my poor cat. She loves me,
and I love her. She has grown such a
beauty, sir, and she can almost talk. I
could not get on without her, please, sir."</p>

<p>10. "Well, if you cannot be parted,
why not go too?" "So I could, sir," said
Dick. "Well, you are a smart boy, and
we will see. The captain lives near. You
had better run and ask him what he
thinks."</p>

<p>11. Dick was not long in fetching his
cap. He almost flew along the streets,
and as he did so he heard Bow bells begin
to ring.</p>

<p>12. He felt so full of high spirits at
the thought of ending his hard life in the
kitchen, with the cross cook, that the bells
seemed to be singing a merry tune to
him.</p>

<p>13. Dick stopped for a moment to listen,
and as he did so, their chime came to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
ears like the sound of his own name.
They seemed to say:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Turn again, Whittington,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lord Mayor of London."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>14. "This must be my fancy," said Dick,
as he ran on to the house of the captain.
"But it is very pleasant to be spoken to
kindly, even by the bells. And I wonder
whether good fortune is in store for me at
last?"</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p><i>Write:</i> Dick could not part with his
cat. So his master said that he might go
with her in the ship. He went to ask the
captain.</p>

<blockquote><p>Questions: 1. What did Alice ask Dick? 2. What did Dick
answer? 3. What did his master say when he came into the
room? 4. What was Dick's reply? 5. Where did he run?
6. What did he hear the bells say?</p></blockquote>


<h3>5. THE KING'S DINNER.</h3>

<p>1. The ship, with Dick and his cat on
board, was soon at sea. But Dick began
to think that worse luck than ever was
going to befall him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>2. For there was a heavy storm, and the
ship was nearly wrecked on the coast of a
land then unknown to the English. This
land was filled with black people called
Moors.</p>

<p>3. When the captain and his men, with
Dick and the cat, landed on this shore,
the natives came in great numbers to gaze
at them. They had never seen people
with white faces before.</p>

<p>4. As they came to know the captain
and his sailors better, these black men
would go on board the ship. The English
sailors showed them all the goods which
they had brought from England.</p>

<p>5. The black men wished to buy them.
As they had gold in great lumps and
heaps, they were willing to give a high
price for what the servants had sent out
from the merchant's house.</p>

<p>6. The captain, seeing how much pleasure
the things gave, sent some of the goods to
the king of the country. He was so much
pleased with them that he sent for the
captain and his friends to the palace.</p>

<p>7. As Dick and his cat had been very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
useful on the voyage, the captain took
them with him, and they soon reached the
palace.</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/image006.png" width="600" height="416" alt="THE DINNER TABLE." title="THE DINNER TABLE." />
<span class="caption">THE DINNER TABLE.</span>
</p>

<p>8. Here they sat on cushions and
carpets made of rich silk and worked in
gold and silver. And the king and queen
being seated at the upper end of the table,
the dinner was brought in.</p>

<p>9. But no sooner were the dishes set in
front of them, in plates of gold and silver,
than a rushing sound was heard. In an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
instant a whole army of mice and rats
came running in.</p>

<p>10. They were so bold that they leaped
on the table and began to devour the food
from the king's own plate. In a few
minutes nothing would have been left.</p>

<p>11. The guests had to drive them away,
and snatch a few hasty morsels before they
came back again. But the creatures seemed
to care for nothing, for they ran back as
fast as they were made to go.</p>

<p>12. The captain was full of surprise.
"Are not these mice and rats a great
trouble to you?" he asked the king. "Oh
yes, they are indeed!" said he.</p>

<p>13. "They not only eat up almost all we
have, but they disturb us even in our own
bedrooms. We are sadly afraid that there
will be a famine next year, for they are eating
up all the seed and corn in the land."</p>

<p>14. The captain was ready to jump for
joy when he heard this, for he called to
mind the cat, which Dick had left in the
ship.</p>

<p>15. As it was not far off, he bade Dick
run and fetch her at once. "I think we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
can help you," he said to the king; but
he only shook his head, for he had tried
all ways to get rid of the rats and mice,
without success.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p><i>Write:</i> The captain sold the goods for
a good price. He went to see the king of
that land. He found that there were
many rats and mice at the palace.</p>

<blockquote><p>Questions: 1. What misfortune happened to the ship?

landed? 3. What did they give instead of the goods? 4. Where
did the captain go with his friends next? 5. What went on at

<h3>6. THE QUEEN AND THE KITTENS.</h3>

<p>1. Taking puss in his arms, Dick was
surprised to find that she tried to get
away from him again, and to run down to
the cabin below. This was the first time
that she had done so, and he could not
make it out.</p>

<p>2. She struggled to get away each time
that Dick tried to carry her out of the
ship, making an odd sort of "miew," and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
trying to coax him to come where she
led him.</p>

<p>3. At last he ran after puss, down the
cabin steps, and at the bottom, in a dark
corner, he found that puss had hidden five
pretty little kittens!</p>

<p>4. She was purring with all her might
over them, and she tried to say, "Did you
ever see five such sweet little things? How
could you ask me to leave them? They
would die if I did. Though I love you
dearly I cannot go away."</p>

<p>5. So Dick found a warm piece of flannel,
and wrapping the baby pussies up in it,
he took the whole lot with him. Puss was
ready enough to come when she saw this.</p>

<p>6. He made as much haste as he could.
Soon he came into the palace with the
kittens under one arm and their proud
mother purring under the other.</p>

<p>7. No sooner did Dick enter than the
cat began to sniff the air. Then she
caught a glimpse of the rats and mice,
which were still feasting on the table.
The cloth was black with them.</p>

<p>8. In one instant she sprang from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
arms. She laid a dozen rats and mice
dead at the king's feet in half a minute,
and all the rest were scared out of their
wits, and ran away.</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 311px;">
<img src="images/image007.png" width="311" height="450" alt="SWEET LITTLE THINGS." title="SWEET LITTLE THINGS." />
<span class="caption">SWEET LITTLE THINGS.</span>
</p>

<p>9. They had never seen a cat before, for
there were none in that land. The king
had never seen one either; and his queen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
did not know what sort of beast puss was
at all. But she thought her very pretty.</p>

<p>10. "What is this strange, useful creature;
what is it called?" said the king, "and
where did you get it? I will give all I
have to buy it from you, rather than be
left without one."</p>

<p>11. But though the king sent for a great
sack of gold, so heavy that it took three
men to bring it into the room, Dick would
not hear of selling his friend.</p>

<p>12. "What is that bundle under your
arm?" said the captain to Dick. And
then the boy showed him the kittens.</p>

<p>13. "Why these are even more pretty
than the beast itself," said the queen, and
she wished to have all the kittens in her
lap. Poor woman! she had never before
nursed a kitten in her life!</p>

<p>14. "You had better sell these to the
king," the captain said in a whisper to
Dick. "Tell him that some day they will
grow up to be cats like yours, and in due
time will have little ones of their own."</p>

<p>15. "But it would be cruel to take them
all away from their mother," said Dick, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
he had seen how quickly his cat had run
to the queen to beg for her little ones.</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption">THE KING AND THE QUEEN.</span>
</p>

<p>16. The cat was not afraid to stare even
into the face of a king, and ask him bravely
to put down the little kit which he had
taken into his royal hands.</p>

<p>17. Puss had at last taken all her treasures
to a mat near the door, where she
was busy washing their faces. She did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
care to have so many folks pulling them
about.</p>

<p>18. "You must leave one for the mother,
and sell the rest," said the captain. "She
will not fret long if you leave her one
child. And we cannot take them all five
back on the ship. There would be too
many."</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p><i>Write:</i> Dick found that his cat had five
little kits. He took them with him to the
house of the king. The queen was pleased;
she had never seen a kitten before.</p>

<blockquote><p>Questions: 1. What was Dick surprised to find when he took
up his cat? 2. Where did she try to lead him? 3. What had
puss got in a corner? 4. How did Dick manage to bring the
kittens to the palace? 5. What did his cat do when she got
there? 6. What did the queen wish?</p></blockquote>


<h3>7. THE END OF PUSSY.</h3>

<p>1. "But I should like them to stay
little always," said the queen, after she
had been told that the kittens would soon
grow big enough to catch mice.</p>

<p>2. "That is a foolish remark, my love,"
said the king. "They are here to kill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
mice, and the sooner they get big, the
better.</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 377px;">

<span class="caption">PUSSY&#39;S GRAVE.</span>
</p>

<p>3. "And you forget that they will have
kittens by-and-by," added the king. "In
time we shall have,&mdash;what is their name?
oh, cats.</p>

<p>4. "Well, we shall have cats enough to
keep the whole land free from mice and
rats." And he was ready to dance and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
clap his hands. Only that would not have
been proper for a king.</p>

<p>5. The end of it was that Dick and the
captain set sail for England with a shipload
of gold, and puss went with them, with
her one baby. She did not miss the rest
much after a time.</p>

<p>6. When Dick reached London again,
he was very rich indeed. But as he grew
older he learned that money cannot make
people happy, unless they do good to
others with it.</p>

<p>7. He gave his friend the captain a
handsome present of gold, and he did not
forget one of his old friends at home. To
each one he gave what they most needed.</p>

<p>8. Even the cross cook was not passed
over, for Dick thought that her bad temper
might be made better by a gift, and so it
was.</p>

<p>9. But there was one above all to
whom he showed the greatest care. This
was his cat. Of course she did not live so
long as Dick did, for the lives of cats do
not often last more than about sixteen
years.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>10. By the time that Dick was the father
of some dear little children, his faithful
old puss was very very old and weak. Alice
was now his wife.</p>

<p>11. Pussy spent all her time by the
warm fire, and she had all she wanted.
No one was ever unkind to her, and
though she was not able to catch mice
any more, she was treated with great
honour.</p>

<p>12. One day, as Dick, now a fine rich
man in good clothes and in a grand house,
was sitting in his arm-chair, his old puss
dragged herself slowly up to his feet.</p>

<p>13. She begged to get on his lap once
more. Dick, who knew well what she
meant, though she could not speak, stooped
and lifted her up.</p>

<p>14. Pussy purred, as she lifted her dim
eyes to his face, gave one sigh, and lay
quite still. She was dead, and Dick
buried her himself, under a laurel tree in
his garden.</p>

<p>15. "If it had not been for her I might
have died in the streets myself," said he.
"It was puss who made my fortune, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
am certain of this one thing: those who
show mercy and love, will have the same
shown to them."</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p><i>Write:</i> Dick sold his kittens for gold.

</p>

<h2>TRUSTY.</h2>


<h3>1. HUNGRY.</h3>

<p>1. "I think that we shall have a heavy
fall of snow before long," said the landlord
of the little wayside inn, at which I had
called to get a morsel of bread and cheese.</p>

<p>2. "Very likely it will snow," said I,
giving a glance at the dark heavy clouds,
and stopping to listen for a moment to the
moaning wind.</p>

<p>3. "And in that case the sooner I start
the better, for I have a long distance to go,
and the light will fail early, in such weather
as this."</p>

<p>4. The landlord turned and looked at
me, as I began putting on my great-coat.
"Do you think that it is wise of you to
venture across the moor, when it is likely
to be so stormy?" said he.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>5. "It is a rough road at the best of
times, but on a bleak night with snow
there is real danger. The trap will take
you over in no time when it comes in, or
as soon as it is light in the morning."</p>

<p>6. "My friend," said I, "do not think of
such a thing. I would not be away from
home to-morrow for all the world. It is
the birthday of my only little girl, and she
would think the day quite spoilt if her
father were not there.</p>

<p>7. "I shall step out briskly, and be at
home long before dark. It is not three
o'clock yet," I added, pulling out my watch.</p>

<p>"Well, I wish you a safe journey, sir,"
said the landlord. "And also, many happy
returns of to-morrow."</p>

<p>8. "Thank you, landlord," replied I, in
the same hearty tone. I shook hands with
him, for his face was a beaming and kindly
one, and I had known him since I was a
boy.</p>

<p>9. As I went towards the outer door,
the landlord just behind me, his man darted
forward from a dark corner, and began to
bustle out in front of me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>10. "Get out, you brute!" he said, in
an angry voice, as he made a savage kick
at something which was crouching in the
shadow of the doorstep.</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/image011.png" width="600" height="384" alt="POOR DOGGIE." title="POOR DOGGIE." />
<span class="caption">POOR DOGGIE.</span>
</p>

<p>11. An instant after, with a dismal yelp
of despair, a forlorn dog slunk away from
the door, and ran to hide under an empty
waggon which stood in the middle of the
road.</p>

<p>12. "Get out! Be off!" again shouted
the man, and he made a pretence of stooping
with great fury to pick up a stone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
The wretched dog, wild with terror, left
his hiding-place.</p>

<p>13. With his drooping tail between his
legs, he crept to the gate of the yard, where
he again lay down and blinked his great
sad eyes at us, licking his hungry mouth
as if to beg for food.</p>

<p>14. I was deeply touched at the sight
of this poor creature's distress, and I could
not help thinking how warm and well fed
I was myself, as well as the other two
men, while this wretched dog, for no fault
of his own, was starving.</p>

<p>15. "Poor thing!" I said, and turning
to the landlord, added, "Do pray let some
one bring him a few scraps and bones from
the kitchen. I will gladly pay for one
good meal for him."</p>

<p>16. "Oh no, oh dear no!" cried the landlord
and the man, both in a voice of horror.
"If we gave him food in this yard we
should never get rid of him.</p>

<p>17. "We should have a bother with
starving dogs here, all the year round,
sir. Pray do not give him food here, I
beg."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p><i>Write:</i> A man saw a hungry dog at an
inn. He wished to feed him, but the landlord
said that he should never get rid of
the dog if he had food there.</p>

<blockquote><p>Questions: 1. What sort of weather was it when the man was
at the inn? 2. What did the landlord advise him to do?
3. What did the man answer? 4. What did the traveller see
outside the inn door? 5. What did he wish to do for the
starving dog? 6. What did the landlord and his man say?</p></blockquote>


<h3>2. A KIND MAN.</h3>

<p>1. I now felt that this landlord was not
a truly good and kind man, or he would
have taken pity on the outcast dog. As I
passed through the gate, the poor creature
huddled close against the wall.</p>

<p>2. He had been taught to expect a kick
or a blow from each person who passed. I
stopped for a moment to look at him, and
said, "Poor fellow!" in a gentle tone.</p>

<p>3. In an instant all the love and grief
in his doggish heart welled over, and with
a sharp cry of pain, which was like a prayer
to me, he drew himself along the ground
to my feet, yelping and wagging his tail at
the same time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>4. He began to lick and fondle my feet,
and made the shining polish on them quite
dim with his muddy paws.</p>

<p>"Poor old fellow!" I said again. "Come,
you shall have one good meal if money can
buy it."</p>

<p>5. I walked out into the street, and
called him to follow. He thought it was
too good news to be true, and only came
for a few steps, then stopped to look with
a timid gaze into my face as if to question
me.</p>

<p>6. "Come along, doggie," I replied, "do
not be afraid. I shall not hurt you. I mean
to be good to you, though you can hardly
believe it. Come and get some dinner."</p>

<p>7. Made bold by my tone and manner,
the dog stuck close to me, and we went
along the High Street. All the shops
were gay and smart, but at first I could
not see one which the dog would have
thought a good shop.</p>

<p>8. At last I found one where food of
all kinds was sold, and I walked in, my
humble friend at my heels giving a joyful
sniff at the pleasant smells.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 343px;">
<img src="images/image012.png" width="343" height="450" alt="TRUSTY&#39;S MEAL." title="TRUSTY&#39;S MEAL." />
<span class="caption">TRUSTY&#39;S MEAL.</span>
</p>

<p>9. Whole crowds of men and women
were eating at the little tables of which
the shop was full. I pushed my way up
to a counter, and said to the master of the
shop,</p>

<p>10. "Just look at this poor dog. I
want him to have a good meal of meat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
Give him plenty of scraps, and I will pay
you for them."</p>

<p>11. The man looked at me as if he doubted
what I meant, and he seemed to think that
I must be crazy to wish to buy a dinner
for a dog.</p>

<p>12. But when he saw that I was in
earnest, he quickly fetched a great heap of
scraps and bones, which he put down outside
the door.</p>

<p>13. Upon these my dog friend fell, as if
he had been a starving wolf, but he did
not forget to glance up at me before he
began with such a grateful look, and to
give his tail one quick wag of thanks.</p>

<p>14. I could not wait to see him eat as
much as he liked. "I must be off," said
I to the man.</p>

<p>15. "Here Johnny," called the master of
the shop, when I was going away, "just
come here, and keep your eye on this stray
dog; see that he is not driven away till he
has eaten all he wants, and fetch him a
drop of water."</p>

<p>16. I thanked the man for his kindness
and paid for the meat, and I did not forget<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
to leave a penny for the little boy who
was keeping guard over the poor dog.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p><i>Write:</i> The poor dog was taken to a

5. Why could not he wait to see the dog eat? 6. Who watched
while the dog ate his meal?</p></blockquote>


<h3>3. LOST ON THE MOOR.</h3>

<p>1. As I went along, more than one person
who passed me on the way said, "We
shall have a wild night, sir, I advise you
to hurry into shelter."</p>

<p>2. As I set foot upon the first part of
the wide, open moor, where the narrow
path could hardly be seen in the twilight,
a few flakes of snow began to fall.</p>

<p>3. For a moment I began to wonder
whether it would not be better, even now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
to turn back and stay in the town for that
night.</p>

<p>4. But thinking that my wife and dear
little girl would be both sorry and anxious
when I did not appear, I put a stout
heart into the matter, and strode boldly
forward.</p>

<p>5. The snowflakes came down thicker
and faster, my beard and the front of my
coat were quite white, the great brown
moor changed first to a grey, and then to
pure dazzling white too.</p>

<p>6. The whirling flakes blinded me, I felt
giddy from the cold. The storm was now
upon me with full fury, the wind almost
lifted me from my feet.</p>

<p>7. I trusted that the sudden gale would
soon pass over, and folding my arms close
to my body, tried to struggle forward still.
But so far from getting better, the weather
grew worse each moment.</p>

<p>8. With a dreadful feeling of despair,
I found that I could no longer find my way.
I did not know where my home lay, nor
how I must turn my face in order to reach
it. I cried to God for mercy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>9. I now felt that I had been very
foolish in trying to get across the moor on
such a night. Perhaps I might never see
my wife and dear child again.</p>

<p>10. The bitter wind seemed to pierce
through my clothes, I was fast getting
drowsy and ready to fall down. Then the
snow would soon have buried me, and no
one would have seen me alive again.</p>

<p>11. A groan broke from my lips as I
looked around at the waste of snow, but I
was at the same instant startled to hear a
low, plaintive whine close at hand.</p>

<p>12. I turned and saw a large, thin,
starved-looking dog sitting close behind.
He gazed in a troubled way into my face,
when I turned round. It was my poor
fellow of the inn door!</p>

<p>13. As he crept along over the snow to
my feet, he seemed with the same humble
love to say, "Do not send me away, let me
come with you. You are the only person
who has shown me mercy."</p>

<p>14. I stooped and patted him on the
head. "Good dog!" I said, "have you
found me out? Come now, I wish you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
could show me the way home, or else I am
afraid we shall both be frozen to death."</p>

<p>15. He seemed to know what I meant
in some strange way, and just then I heard
far off a church clock strike, which I knew
must be in the town I had left behind.</p>

<p>16. This was a help, for I now knew that
if I turned my back on the place from
which the sound came, I should be right in
keeping straight on.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p><i>Write:</i> The storm grew worse. When
the man had lost his way on the moor, he
saw the dog which he had fed at the inn
sitting behind him.</p>

began his walk? 2. As he began to cross the moor, what did
he see? 3. Did the weather grow any better? 4. What did he

the dog seem to say? 6. What did the traveller hear far off?</p></blockquote>


<h3>4. TRUSTY FINDS THE WAY.</h3>

<p>1. I pointed out to the dog the way I
wished to go, and with a wag of his tail,
the wise creature trotted on slowly in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
front. He seemed to feel that he had the
charge of me and had been trusted.</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 333px;">
<img src="images/image013.png" width="333" height="450" alt="A BITTER NIGHT." title="A BITTER NIGHT." />
<span class="caption">A BITTER NIGHT.</span>
</p>

<p>2. We had not gone far before he gave
a whine, and coming quite close to me,
stared in my face, and changed his course.
He seemed to beg me to turn aside to the
right.</p>

<p>3. I went as he asked me, and as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
was going, I tried with my stick to poke
the ground from which the dog had wished
to turn. I wanted to know why he was
not willing to let me tread just there.</p>

<p>4. I found that a deep pond, over which
a slight cover of ice and snow were spread,
was close beside us. It was an old pit in
which water had frozen.</p>

<p>5. Had I set my foot on it I must have
sunk down and I never could have risen.
"A few inches closer to the edge and
I must have been drowned!" cried I
aloud, and did not forget to thank God for
the escape.</p>

<p>6. The dog now stopped a few feet off as
if to watch whether I was coming, and
again trotted forward as I praised him
and began to follow.</p>

<p>7. Soon he gave a second whine, and
again seemed to wish me to turn aside. I
trod in his footprints, and again was safe.
I was now nearly ready to faint from cold.</p>

<p>8. "Go on, good dog," said I to my
faithful guide, "lead me home quickly, or
I shall die." He gave a hoarse bark in
reply, as if to bid me keep a good heart.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>9. I was just falling down, for I could
walk no further, when he gave a short, eager
bark of joy; at least it seemed like joy, I
thought, but my ears were deaf, and my
eyes dim.</p>

<p>10. I gave one last hopeless glance
around, and saw something large and dark
in front. It was a wooden shed, the black
inside of which showed plainly against the
whiteness all around.</p>

<p>11. I knew that it must be one of the
huts which the men used who were digging
peat on the moor, and the thought filled
me with terror, for I knew that these huts
were very far away from my home.</p>

<p>12. But all other feelings went from me
now; I had a strong wish to rest, and that
was all. I crept into the hut and lay down,
thinking that I would wait there till the
storm was over.</p>

<p>13. The dog came in after me, and laid
himself down close to my side. I felt
more sleepy than I had ever done in my
life before, my eyes ached, and bright lights
seemed to be flashing in front of them.</p>

<p>14. I thought of my home, wife, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
child, and then sleep stole upon me. Once
I woke with the hoarse bark of the dog
ringing in my ears. He was doing his best
to wake me from the sleep which must end
in death out there on the bitter moor.</p>

<p>15. A second time he roused me, and I
felt that he had now crept very close to my
breast, and with his fore paws resting on
my shoulders, was licking my face with his
warm tongue.</p>

<p>16. In the act of stroking him and speaking
a kindly word, I again sank to sleep,
and after that I forgot all about the dog,
the shed, and the cold moor. I dreamt
of home, my little girl, and my dear wife.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<h3>5. SAVED BY TRUSTY.</h3>

<p>1. I knew nothing more about myself
until I slowly waked in a warm room, and
saw many strange faces round me.</p>

<span class="caption">CALLING FOR HELP.</span>
</p>

<p>"Oh, thank God!" cried a voice near
me, "the poor man is getting better."</p>

<p>2. "What is the matter?" said I, for I
seemed not to know what all the fuss was
about.</p>

<p>"Here, my dear sir, drink this," said
a voice, and a cup of steaming hot coffee
was placed at my lips.</p>

<p>3. I drank it slowly, and then all that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
I had gone through rushed into my mind.
"What is the time?" I asked of the person
who had given me the hot coffee. He
held my pulse, and I thought that he was
a doctor.</p>

<p>4. "Within ten minutes of midnight,"
was the answer. "And it has taken hours
to bring you round. I was almost giving
you up for dead."</p>

<p>"You found me on the moor?"</p>

<p>5. "Yes, half buried in the snow. You
may thank your dog for your life."</p>

<p>"My dog? I have no dog," said I, for
I did not think of my poor friend at the
moment.</p>

<p>6. "Yes; if it had not been for his faithful
barking and howling, we should not have
set out to seek you. My wife heard him,
and she said that some one must be lost on
the moor.</p>

<p>7. "The dog guided us to the shed. He
had kept your face clear of snow by licking
it, and had kept a little warmth in
your body by lying on it; if he had not,
you would now have been dead. We dug
you out, and brought you here."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>8. I thanked the doctor for his goodness,
but my mind was chiefly fixed on that
other friend, who was not dumb, for he
had spoken for me after his own plan.</p>

<p>9. How great a reward he had given
me for a few bones and a friendly word!</p>

<p>"Where is he now?" I asked in an
eager tone.</p>

<p>"Who?&mdash;the dog? Oh, he is tied up in
the stable.</p>

<p>10. "He was so much in the way, and
did so much to hinder us by his attempts
to show his fondness for you, that we had to
shut him up. Hark! Do you hear him?"</p>

<p>11. As the doctor spoke, a long, doleful
howl was borne past the windows of the
room. It seemed to speak of pain, longing,
reproach: all feelings that a dog who
had been ill repaid for his love could put
into the sound.</p>

<p>12. "Oh, let him out, please! let him
out, do!" cried I. "I cannot bear to hear
him howl like that."</p>

<p>I then told them the story of the dog.
And in the midst of the surprise which all
felt at hearing it, he came in.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>13. At a word from me, he jumped up
by the side of the bed, and barked out all
his joy at seeing me again. You may be
sure that the dog was not left behind when
I started that next day for home.</p>

</p>

<p>14. And you may guess what my wife
and little girl thought of him. They gave
him the name of Trusty, which he had
well earned.</p>

<p>15. He had a share of the birthday feast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
which took place a day later than the right
one. No one at the table enjoyed a taste
of each dish more than Trusty.</p>

<p>16. The fruit was the only thing which
he did not care for. His looks improved
day after day. He is my friend and the
dearly loved playmate of my little girl.</p>

<p>17. I often look back with a most thankful
heart to the day that I met him at the
inn-door, and my wife has always a pat, a
loving word, and a treat in the shape of
some nice bone, for our Trusty.</p>

<h2><a name="OUT_IN_THE_COLD" id="OUT_IN_THE_COLD"></a>OUT IN THE COLD.</h2>


<h3>1. POOR OLD BROWNIE.</h3>

<p>1. "What a sharp night it is, Peter, to be
sure!" said a pale woman to her husband,
as she sat rocking her baby in its cradle
by the fire.</p>

<p class="figleft" style="width: 289px;">
<img src="images/image016.png" width="289" height="400" alt="" title="" />
</p>

<p>2. She had been
but poorly, and
had felt the cold
very much.
"Very sharp, indeed!"
said her
husband. "I feel
pains in all my
poor old bones."</p>

<p>3. "If you and I feel
cold here," said he, "by
the warm fire, after our
good supper, what must it be outside, for
those poor souls that have nothing to eat,
and no fire?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>4. "Ah, bad indeed!" said his wife.
"And for the poor dumb beasts, too. How
glad I am that we had that nice dry house
made for the cow this summer, and the
new place for the cocks and hens!</p>

<p>5. "They would have been half frozen
under that broken roof as it used to be
when we first came here."</p>

<p>6. Her eldest child, a little-girl, looked
up from her knitting. "The hens are all
quite snug, mother, Fluffy and Biddy and
the rest. I peeped in just now, after they
were gone to roost."</p>

<p>7. "You are always a kind little one to
the dumb things," said her father, stroking
the soft brown head of Mercy, who had
just spoken. "And so is my little Nelly,
too," he added, looking fondly at the
second child, who sat on his knee.</p>

<p>8. "It is getting late for the children,
Peter," said his wife. "Shall Mercy read
a bit, before we go to bed?" So Mercy,
who was a good scholar, took the Bible
from the shelf and read aloud a few verses
which her father found for her.</p>

<p>9. They told of the manger, and of how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
the ox and the ass stood by one bitter
night like this, when the infant Christ was
laid in it long ago. "Thank you, dear,"
said her mother, when Mercy had done.
"Now run up to your warm bed."</p>

<p>10. "Oh look, Mercy, how nice!" cried
little Nelly, "we have got a new blanket!"
"That is because the squire sent it to
mother; a big new thick one," said her
sister. "How warm we shall be!"</p>

<p>11. Nelly began to make great haste,
while Mercy went to the window and
looked out.</p>

<p>"How thick the snow is!" she said.
"And how white it looks in the moonshine!</p>

<p>12. "But what is that dark thing standing
by the old shed?" Nelly ran up and
pressed her little face against the window
to peep out too. "Why, it is a donkey!"
she cried. "How did it get there?"</p>

<p>13. "I tell you what," said Mercy, "it
is our poor old Brownie, that father sold
last week to Mr. Smith, that he might
pay the doctor's bill with the money.</p>

<p>14. "He had spent all we had in getting
things for mother when she was ill, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
know, and in bread for us. So poor
Brownie had to go."</p>

<p>15. "Why does he not go into the
shed? How stupid of him to stand there!
And why did he not stay with Mr. Smith,
I wonder?"</p>

<p>"I suppose he could not help thinking
about us, and that is why he came back,"
said Mercy. "Perhaps Mr. Smith has no
little girls to pet him, and maybe he is not
so good to him as father was."</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p><i>Write:</i> Two little girls went to their
warm beds. As they looked out at the
window they saw a donkey. It stood out
in the cold.</p>

<blockquote><p>Questions: 1. What sort of night did Peter think it was?
2. What was his wife so glad to think of? 3. What did Mercy
say about the hens' house? 4. What did the children see when
they looked out at the window? 5. What did Mercy think was
the reason why the donkey had come back?</p></blockquote>


<h3>2. A KIND ACT.</h3>

<p>1. Mercy and her little sister watched
at the window for a minute or two more,
but the creature did not move.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>2. And Mercy cried out, "Oh, I quite
forgot! Of course, the shed door is shut!
Father has put his tools there, his spade
and rake.</p>

<p>3. "When Brownie was sold the straw
which was his bed was taken out, and
some sacks of corn and barley were kept
there instead.</p>

<p>4. "Poor Brownie! I dare say he wonders
why his nice old house is shut up so
that he cannot get in!"</p>

<p>5. "I will give him some bread from my
breakfast in the morning, because it is
Christmas Day," said little Nelly. "He
will like that, won't he?"</p>

<p>6. Her sister made no answer, but, moving
from the window, she took down from
a peg her hat and thick jacket. She put
them on.</p>

<p>7. "Why, Mercy!" said Nelly, who
looked with much surprise at what her
sister was doing; "what are you doing?
You cannot be going out now in the
snow?"</p>

<p>8. "Do not make a noise," said Mercy.
"You know that mother is not well, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
perhaps she is just dropping off to sleep.
I cannot bear to leave him freezing out
there all night,&mdash;Christmas Eve and all!</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 402px;">
<img src="images/image017.png" width="402" height="450" alt="OUT IN THE COLD." title="OUT IN THE COLD." />
<span class="caption">OUT IN THE COLD.</span>
</p>

<p>9. "I could not creep under the warm
blanket and forget him. No one will
see him but us, for only our window<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
looks this way. So I am just going to
run out and get the shed open for him."</p>

<p>10. "Oh, sister, you will be so cold!
Cannot you ask father to go?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you heard him say that he had
pains in all his bones. Now be a good
child, Nelly, and get quick into bed. I
shall soon be back."</p>

<p>11. With these words Mercy tied on a
great scarf which was once her father's
round her neck, crept down stairs without
making the least noise, and out at the back
door.</p>

<p>12. Once out of shelter of the house, it
was, as she thought with a shiver, "a
bitter night." The snow was no longer
falling, but a keen wind swept over the
white face of the earth and stirred up the
snow.</p>

<p>13. It piled heaps of it up into strange
shapes. The frost was so hard that the
feet of the child did not sink into it as she
ran along.</p>

<p>14. Very soon she reached the shed, outside
of which the donkey stood, a picture
of patient despair. She plunged through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
a great heap of drifted snow and reached
its side. She patted his rough coat.</p>

<p>15. "Oh, Brownie," she cried, "how
cold you are! I must get this door open
for you somehow." She pulled it, she
jerked it, she kicked it, she shook down
showers of snow on herself, and that was
all.</p>

<p>16. It was in vain to try. It was frozen
hard, and do what she would, she could not
stir it an inch. It was hopeless. "Oh,
what can I do for you, Brownie?" she
thought, ready to cry with grief.</p>

<p>17. "I do so wish you were not so big,
and I could take you up the stairs into our
bed-room!" And Mercy half laughed at
the idea of taking the donkey to bed with
her.</p>

<p>18. She gave one last, hard hit and a
rattle at the unkind door. "I cannot get
it open, Brownie, and I must go home
again. It will not do you any good if I
stay out here with you."</p>

<p>19. Slowly the child moved away. If it
had seemed cold when she first came out,
it seemed ten times colder now. And she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
saw the sad look which the poor beast
cast after her when she left him. Mercy
could not forget it.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p><i>Write:</i> Mercy went out into the cold
that she might open the shed door. She
wished to let the donkey in. But she
could not open it.</p>

<blockquote><p>Questions: 1. What did Mercy remember about the shed?
2. What did she put on? 3. Where did she go? 4. What
was the weather like outside the house? 5. What did she find
on trying to open the shed door? 6. What was it that Mercy
could not forget?</p></blockquote>


<h3>3. THE OLD SHED.</h3>

<p>1. All of a sudden, as Mercy had quite
made up her mind to leave Brownie, and
was half way across the yard to her own
door, a thought struck her.</p>

<p>2. There was an old shed which had once
been the stable of a donkey, quite at the
far end of the garden.</p>

<p>3. Her father had turned it into a pigsty;
but he had left off keeping pigs for
some time. It was a clean place, for Peter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
did not let his pigs live in a dirty sty as
some people do.</p>

<p>4. Some dry straw was in it, and some
roots stored for the winter. It would be
just the place if only she could get Brownie
there.</p>

<p>5. In a moment she turned back to hurry
again over the heap of snow to the place
where the donkey still stood. He could
do nothing for himself to make things
better.</p>

<p>6. All that he could do was to bear
them without any complaint. Poor thing!
He was stiff with cold, and seemed not to
wish to move. But Mercy knew what
was for his good.</p>

<p>7. She meant to do what was best for
poor Brownie, whether he knew it or not.
So she talked to him, patted him, and
coaxed him till at last he let her lead him
down to the old shed at the bottom of the
garden.</p>

<p>8. "This is lucky for you, Brownie,"
cried she, feeling very proud at her success.
There was a bundle of hay in one corner,
of which she shook down a nice soft armful.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>9. And then she gave Brownie one good
brisk rubbing with some of the straw,
to warm them both. She made him a bed
of straw too.</p>

<p>10. Brownie was glad to nibble a mouthful
while this was being done. Then she
took some fine carrots from a shelf, and
put them in front of him. Oh, how
Brownie did munch those fresh juicy roots!</p>

<p>11. Lastly, she found a bucket of clean
water which had not long been drawn from
the well, and which had only a thin coating
of ice on the top.</p>

<p>12. It had been set in the shed ready
for making some mortar, with which father
was going to plaster up the cracks in the
wall.</p>

<p>13. Brownie seemed almost more glad of
the water than of the food. He took a
long drink, and turned to thank Mercy
with his great deep dark eyes.</p>

<p>14. "Now, poor old fellow, I think you
will do," said the child. "I could not bear
to leave you out this bitter night, and now
I must be getting home, for the snow has
soaked through my boots."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>15. She stopped fondling and stroking
the donkey, but he would follow her,
rubbing his soft nose against her hand.
"Oh, go back again, do, dear Brownie!"
she said.</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 567px;">
<img src="images/image018.png" width="567" height="450" alt="THE OLD SHED." title="THE OLD SHED." />
<span class="caption">THE OLD SHED.</span>
</p>

<p>16. "You really must not come out
with me!" Shutting the little gate, which
had once been the front door of the pigsty,
she ran back to the cottage.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p><i>Write:</i> At last the little girl thought of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
a shed. It was at the end of the garden,
and it was a clean place. She put the
donkey there and fed him well.</p>

<blockquote><p>Questions: 1. What thought struck Mercy as she was going
back? 2. What sort of shed was it? 3. What did she do for
Brownie first? 4. What did she give him to lie on? 5. What
did she find for him to eat? 6. What did she give him besides
food?</p></blockquote>


<h3>4. A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.</h3>

<p>1. But when she came to the back door
at which she had come out, Mercy found
a great trouble. She lifted the latch, but
the door did not open.</p>

<p>2. She gave a pull, a second pull, and
then a tug with all her might; but it still
held fast. "Why," she thought, "I am as
badly off as the donkey. I shall have to
go into the pigsty with him!"</p>

<p>3. She had been out much longer than
she thought. And while she had been
taking care of Brownie her father had
turned the big key in the door and gone
to bed.</p>

<p>4. What was to be done? It would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
never do to wake up poor tired father,
and bring him out in the cold too. So she
stood there trying to puzzle out some
plan for getting in.</p>

<p>5. The bright moonlight showed her a
way to do it. The cottage was a low one,
and just under the window of the room
where she and Nelly slept, was a bench.</p>

<p>6. Standing on tiptoe upon this, Mercy
found that she could reach the branches
of an old vine tree, which grew over the
walls of the little house.</p>

<p>7. She could climb up into this, and so
get near the bedroom window. It was
easy enough to scramble up in summer
time, but not so easy now.</p>

<p>8. The boughs were a sheet of ice, and
her fingers so cold that they could hardly
take hold of them. At last, after many
slips and frights, she was safely up.</p>

<p>9. But what would little Nelly think of
seeing her sister outside the window, asking
to be let in, as their pussy cat often
did?</p>

<p>10. She was sound asleep too, and had
to be wakened by many hard taps at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
glass. First, Nelly felt fear at seeing a
face looking in at her.</p>

<p>11. But she soon knew who it was. "Oh
Mercy," cried Nelly, "how long you have
been! What have you been at? And
why did you come back this way?"</p>

<p>12. "Get into bed again, there's a dear,"
said Mercy, "and I will tell you all about
it." Nelly kept awake to listen, as Mercy
told her the story.</p>

<p>13. And she could not help clapping
her hands to think of how snug poor
old Brownie was now. Mercy knelt down
to say her prayers before she got into
bed.</p>

<p>14. She felt very thankful that she had
been able to do one kindness to a creature
like that ass which once stood in the stall
beside the "new-born King."</p>

<p>15. Next morning, as soon as the house
was tidy, Mercy ran out to see the donkey.
More snow had fallen in the night, and had
filled up all her footmarks, so that she might
have thought it all a dream.</p>

<p>16. But just as she reached the pigsty
she heard a loud bray, which was Brownie's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
way of saying "A Merry Christmas" to his
friends.</p>

<p>17. "You did quite right, my child,"
said her father, when Mercy told him of
her work the last night. "I think that
Smith does not treat him well.</p>

<p>18. "And I will tell you what, children,
I am going to-morrow to see Mr. Smith and
buy our Brownie back again. I cannot get
on without him, I find.</p>

<p>19. "Now that your mother is well again
we shall do better, and last week I put by
the money for Brownie. So you need
never say good-bye to him again."</p>

<p>20. You may be sure that there was a
happy Christmas at the cottage for Peter
and his wife, and for the children, as well
as for poor Brownie.</p>

<p>21. "How very glad I am that I went
out to him that night!" said Mercy to her
father. "It was not much to do, only it
was Christmas Eve, and I thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>22. "You thought what?" said her
father.</p>

<p>"Only," she said, in a low voice, "I
could not forget that Christ let the ox and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
the ass be with Him in the stable. And I
thought that He would not be pleased
if we left poor Brownie out in the cold."</p>

<h2>THE STORY OF A FLY.</h2>


<h3>1. ROSE.</h3>


<p class="figleft" style="width: 254px;">
<img src="images/image019.png" width="254" height="450" alt="" title="" />
</p>

<p>1. The first time
that I ever used my
wings was in flying
from behind a red
curtain. It was in a
warm nice breakfast-room.
The master of
it was called Mr. Sutton.</p>

<p>2. I settled on a pretty
white cap on the head of his
wife. She was just making the
tea, and her husband was sitting
on the other side of the table.</p>

<p>3. "Well," said Mr. Sutton, "when I
talk of lazy folks, of course I do not suppose
that any person thinks himself idle.</p>

<p>4. "Some people think that so long as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
they are doing something or other they are
busy. I suppose that I am an idle old
fellow myself, for spending time in reading
the paper.</p>

<p>5. "The right thing to think is, have
I been doing what is of any use, eh?"
said the old man, pushing up his glasses
and looking at his little grandchild.</p>

<p>6. "Have you done a single thing that
is of any use this morning, Rose?" Rose
hung her head for a moment. Then she
lifted her face brightly, and said, "Only
one little thing, grandpa."</p>

<p>7. "What was it, dear?"</p>

<p>"I am not quite sure that it was a real
good thing," Rose went on, "but I found a
poor little butterfly that had fallen into a
pool in the garden, where the rain had come.</p>

<p>8. "Its wings were wet, and it could not
fly up. So I took it up and put it in the
sun on the wall, and soon it was well."</p>

<p>9. Mrs. Sutton looked at Rose in a loving
way. "I am quite sure that it was a 'real
good thing' if you are not," said the old
lady. "And so that was partly why you
were late?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>10. "Yes, granny."</p>

<p>"Well, the little butterfly is all the
better, though you were the worse for
having cold toast. But that is not much
to bear for the sake of saving a little life,
is it?"</p>

<p>11. And all this time I had been feasting
on the sweet white lumps of sugar. No
one took any notice of me, and so I went
on, till one lump began to grow quite small.</p>

<p>12. "Look, here is a little house-fly!"
said Rose. "He is standing quite still on
a lump of sugar. What is he doing,
granny?"</p>

<p>"He is eating it, dear."</p>

<p>"Can he bite it up?"</p>

<p>13. "Bite it up! No," said Mr. Sutton,
putting down his paper and coming up to
us. "The fly has no teeth, he has a trunk.
He sends down some juice through his
trunk on to the sugar.</p>

<p>14 "This juice melts it, and then he
sucks it up again."</p>

<p>"How clever!" said Rose. "I wish he
would let me touch him." And she put
out one finger very softly towards me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>15. Now though I am a brave fly now,
I could not bear at that time to see the
hand of any person come near me. Though
I would perch on the top of it, I did not
like to be touched by it.</p>

<p>16. So I flew up in a great hurry, and
pitched on some dark stuff which smelt
like new hay, and which stood on the side
table in a box. Rose did not see where I
went. "Oh, how fast he went off!" she
said.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<h3>2. IN THE TEA-CADDY.</h3>

<p>1. "Now, granny," said Rose, when the
breakfast was done, "I will not forget, to-day
at least, to lock up the tea-caddy."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>2. So she took up the sugar-basin, fitted
it into a little place made for it inside the
box where I sat, and, before I had any idea
of what she was doing, she shut down the
lid.</p>

<p>3. I was now, for the first time, left in
the dark. And I began to think what a
pleasant thing the sunshine was, and to
wonder when I should be let out again.</p>

<p>4. But I must say that I found the sugar
a great comfort. I went on eating it as long
as I could. If I was to be locked up at all,
I could not have been locked into a better
place.</p>

<p>5. The sugar-basin was full and there
were enough lumps in it to last a fly of my
size all his life. But of course one might
get tired of it, in time.</p>

<p>6. But I was not tired yet. So I ate and
ate, until I began to feel my legs ache and
my wings very heavy. Just then I heard a
loud noise, and a light broke into my prison.</p>

<p>7. It was Rose turning the key in the
lock and lifting the lid of the tea-caddy.
"Oh, granny!" cried she, "here is a poor
fly that can hardly move."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>8. "I am afraid, dear, that the poor fly
must thank himself for that," said Mrs.
Sutton, looking closely at me. "He has
been a little glutton, I fear, and has eaten
so much sugar that he can hardly move."</p>

<p>9. "Poor little fellow," said Rose, "I will
not hurt him. He shall go out of doors
on to the cool grass and get well again.</p>

<p>10. "I dare say that, though he is not
quite so pretty as a butterfly, he likes to
be alive." So Rose took me up between
her finger and thumb as gently as she
could, but oh, what great big hands they
seemed to me!</p>

<p>11. And my poor sides were pinched
black and blue. That is the reason why
I cannot bear one of the great hands
which belong to men and women to catch
hold of me.</p>

<p>12. You see we tiny flies are made so
lightly, and we are so small. A mere
touch will crush our dainty wings, or break
our slender legs, or hurt our eyes.</p>

<p>13. How thankful I am that we have
eyes that can see behind and all round us
as well as in front!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>14. We are able to get away, thanks to
these eyes, when we see a great hand
coming to catch us. Even a baby's hand
seems like that of a giant to us.</p>

<span class="caption">ROSE DID HER BEST FOR ME.</span>
</p>

<p>15. But dear Rose did her best for me,
and put me in a spoon to carry. At the
same time I did wish that the sugar had
not been quite so nice, and that I had not
taken so much of it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>16. The fresh air of the garden, the
sunshine, and the flowers did me a great
deal of good, after being shut up in the tea-caddy.
At night I slept in a lily bell.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<h3>3. I FALL INTO THE CREAM.</h3>

<p>1. The next morning I flew in at the
window. Rose had soon done her breakfast,
and she locked up the caddy again, with
me outside this time.</p>

<p>2. Though I did not fancy any sweets
on that morning, I saw something in a
small jug on the table which I thought
looked even nicer. It was yellow and
rather thick.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>3. I went down to see what sort of stuff
it was. It could not hurt me, at any rate,
to dip one of my feet in, or the tip of my
trunk, and see whether cream was better
and more wholesome than sugar.</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 511px;">
<img src="images/image021.png" width="511" height="450" alt="SOMETHING IN A SMALL JUG." title="SOMETHING IN A SMALL JUG." />
<span class="caption">SOMETHING IN A SMALL JUG.</span>
</p>

<p>4. I slid with care down the sides of the
jug, holding firmly on with the little soles
of my feet, which, I am thankful to say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
have suckers on them which make it easy
for me to run where I like without falling.</p>

<p>5. I tasted cream for the first time In my
life. What a happy moment it was! I
tasted it a second time, a third, and a
fourth time, and after that I became so
greedy for more that I lost my balance
and in I went plump!</p>

<p>6. At first I kicked about as hard as I
could, and tried to keep my wings clear.
But they soon got cold, and stuck to my
sides.</p>

<p>7. And then I could only go round
and round the place, looking with despair
at the steep sides of the cream-jug, which
seemed far larger and steeper than they
had done before my sad mishap.</p>

<p>8. I was growing tired of the struggle,
my body began to sink in the cream, and
even my eyes were dimmed by it, so that I
could hardly see where I was going.</p>

<p>9. Thomas the servant came in to take
away the breakfast things, and the jolt he
gave the cream-jug in moving it closer to
the tea-pot nearly drowned me. I was
half dead.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>10. But Rose was again my friend,
though she did not mean to do what she
then did. Rushing into the room to fetch
a book which she had left on the window
seat, she ran against Thomas, and pushed
his elbow.</p>

<p>11. This jerked the cream-jug so that it
upset and I was upset with it. I felt myself
crawling along in a great white flood
over the table-cloth, but still I had land
under my feet.</p>

<p>12. "My dear Rose," said Mrs. Sutton,
"how often I have begged you not to rush
into the room in that rough way. You
nearly knocked down Thomas, and see how
his sleeve is messed with greasy cream!"</p>

<p>13. "I am very sorry, granny," said
Rose, "but I forgot this book, and Miss
Bush is waiting."</p>

<p>"I am sorry too," said Mrs. Sutton, "and
so is Thomas, I dare say."</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

6. What happened to the cream-jug and to the fly?</p></blockquote>


<h3>4. SWEET AS HONEY.</h3>

<p>1. Rose had to go away, to finish her
lessons, and Thomas also went out of the
room to get a cloth to wipe up the spilt
cream.</p>

<p>2. I was in danger of being swept
away by this, but, just as Rose was going
out at the door, she saw me still in the
midst of the cream.</p>

<p>3. In an instant I found myself nearly
drowned again in a spoonful of it, and the
next moment I was again placed on the
grass of the lawn.</p>

<p>4. Rose had scooped me up in the spoon
and carried me there. I really think that
she had a liking for me. How thankful
I felt to be in the grass!</p>

<p>5. I hid myself under a daisy flower and
took a good rest, for I felt very tired after
my struggles. A good shower of rain came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
on, and I was quite glad to hear it patter
on the leaves.</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 412px;">
<img src="images/image022.png" width="412" height="400" alt="" title="" />
</p>

<p>6. For I still felt a trifle sticky, and was
glad to get my legs moist, so that I might
wash myself all the better. At this time
the sun was so warm, that I lived out of
doors for some days.</p>

<p>7. I think that three days passed before
I sat again on the white cap of Mrs.
Sutton. But one morning, when she sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
at the open window, I thought I should
like to pay my old friend a visit.</p>

<p>8. It was breakfast time again. Mr.
Sutton was reading the paper through his
new glasses, and Rose was busy eating her
breakfast.</p>

<p>9. As I had had nothing but a few tastes
of dew, and such small meals as were to be
had from the flowers, for three days, I was
rather hungry.</p>

<p>10. I thought that Rose would spare me
a bit of what was on her plate. But, as I
was on the way to it, I had to pass a pot of
something which had a better smell than
what she was then eating.</p>

<p>11. It was honey. It made me forget
all about Rose, and her bread and butter.
I pitched on the honey-pot, and began to
feast as hard as I could.</p>

<p>12. But before I had eaten much, I
saw Rose take some and spread it on a
piece of bread. At the same moment Mrs.
Sutton rose and put the honey into a cupboard.</p>

<p>13. "The flies will get at this, if it is
left without a cover," she said. "I cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
think why Thomas has brought it in to
table without one."</p>

<p>14. Now I thought this a most unkind
speech. They were all eating twenty
times as much as I could do in a week at
each mouthful. Yet the honey was put
into a dark cupboard out of my reach!</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p><i>Write:</i> The fly was glad to clean his
wings and legs. He came back to the
room and sat on the cap of the old lady.
He was pleased to get some honey.</p>

<blockquote><p>Questions: 1. What did Rose do for the fly in the cream?
2. What did the fly do in the garden? 3. What did the fly find on
the breakfast-table? 4. Where did he pitch next? 5. What did
the old lady do with the honey-pot? 6. What did the fly think
of what she said?</p></blockquote>


<h3>5. A NEW MISHAP.</h3>

<p>1. This vexed me, I must say, so I went
and buzzed against the window panes for
a little while, to see if that would do me
any good.</p>

<p>2. At the end of that time I heard Rose
say, "Granny, I do not want this bread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
and honey now. May I keep it for my
lunch?"</p>

<p>3. "Yes, dear," said her granny. It
seemed a wonder to me that Rose should
wish to leave her bread and honey till some
hours later, when she might have had it at
once.</p>

<p>4. Mr. Sutton got up and went away to
his study. His wife rose too, and she told
Rose to put the plate of bread and honey
on the sideboard, that Thomas might take
it away till lunch time.</p>

<p>5. But Rose forgot to tell Thomas, and
he did not seem to see the plate, so there
the tempting dish was left all the morning.
The sun began to shine upon it, and I
sniffed and sniffed many times.</p>

<p>6. At last I left the white cap where I
was sitting, and went towards it. I settled
upon something far nicer now than either
sugar or cream. I sipped and sucked away
for some time.</p>

<p>7. At last I thought that I had eaten
enough and had better tear myself away
before I had taken more than was good
for me. But, to my horror, I found that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
when I tried to lift up my legs I could not
stir them!</p>

<p>8. In my other troubles I had at least
been able to move a little. I could climb
up and down the mountains of sugar, and
I could swim about in the ocean of cream.</p>

<p>9. But now I was fixed fast, either to be
eaten by Rose without her knowing it, or
to die a wretched death in the kitchen if
she did not choose to finish me off.</p>

<p>10. I had never thought very much of
my out-door cousins, the bees. It seemed
to me that they made a great fuss and
took a lot of trouble for nothing, in making
honey for men and women to take away.</p>

<p>11. How much better to eat it straight
from the flowers! And now I thought
worse of the bees than ever, because I was
sticking fast in their stuff.</p>

<p>12. I tried in vain to drag out one
front leg after the other, and next my
middle and back legs. It was just as a
man would feel if he were stuck in a bog.</p>

<p>13. The sound of the lunch bell went to
my heart. The sight of the nice bread
and honey, which Rose had left at breakfast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
would be sure to make her feel hungry.
She very soon saw me!</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p><i>Write:</i> The fly stood on a plate of bread
and honey. He stuck fast and felt as a

2. What did the fly do when he smelt it? 3. What happened to

see when she came to lunch?</p></blockquote>


<h3>6. THE FLY'S EYE.</h3>

<p>1. I feel sure that she did not know me,
for she cried out, "Oh, granny! here is a
nasty fly on my bread and honey. I dare
say that the horrid thing has been crawling
all over it!</p>

<p>2. "I wish a spider would come and
catch it!" went on Rose, quite crossly,
"for I do not like to kill it myself!" And
here she gave me a little poke with a
fork. But not hard enough to hurt me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>3. "Why, Rose, what is the matter?"
said her granny. "I thought that you
were fond of the little, busy, useful flies
that come to dance and play in the house?"</p>

<p>4. "Well, I cannot see what good they
do," said Rose, "getting into the cream
and sticking on to the bread and honey."
Something had put little Rose out of
temper. But I felt sure it would not last
long.</p>

<p>5. "I wish he would not get on to my
plate," said she, bending down her face to
hide it, for she began to feel ashamed.
"But I will not hurt him."</p>

<p>6. And she took one of her granny's
knitting needles in her hand. I shook
with fear when I saw this great spear
coming; but Rose used it in a most gentle
and kind way.</p>

<p>7. She lifted my body out after setting
my legs free, and though I felt strained
and tired after it, I left nothing behind
me, no, not even any of the brushes and
combs on my feet.</p>

<p>8. "I will put him out into the garden,"
said she. But, as my wings had got no honey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
on them, I saved her the trouble, by flying
away.</p>

<p>9. If Rose had only known half the
trouble I had in washing my feet after the
honey, she would have been ready to forgive
me for tasting her lunch.</p>

<p>10. "I am glad you did not go on feeling
cross with the poor little fly, Rose," said
Mrs. Sutton. "We should miss them
much if we had none, for they help to keep
our houses sweet and clean.</p>

<p>11. "No maid with her broom could
get at all the tiny cracks and corners where
the flies go. The eyes of no woman in the
world could see what the fly can.</p>

<p>12. "Do you know that his round ball of
eye is made up of many hundreds of bits,
and that each bit can see a new way?"</p>

<p>13. Rose clapped her hands. "Then can
the fly see a hundred ways at once?" said
she. "Oh, how I wish I could do that!"</p>

<p>14. "You can move your eyes about,"
said her granny, "which does just as well.
The fly cannot move his. And you would
not like to be born in the kitchen sink,
would you?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>15. "Is that where flies are born?" said
Rose, drawing near to her granny and looking
into her face.</p>

<p>16. "Yes," said Mrs. Button, "the fly is
born in a sink, or in any place where dirty
stuff is found. The young flies eat the dirty
stuff and get rid of it. I will tell you some
day how the little things come into the
world."</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

honey the fly went off. He cleaned his

6. Tell me where flies are born?</p></blockquote>


<h3>7. BABY FLIES.</h3>

<p>1. "Could you not tell me now?" said
Rose, for she wanted to hear about the
little flies. And I too felt very glad to
hear more about my childhood. So I sat
still to listen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>2. "Perhaps you think that the child
of a fly looks just like itself; only smaller,"
said Mrs. Sutton. "But the house-fly
lays a great many little eggs.</p>

<p>3. "She finds some old dirty rubbish,
like rotten cabbage or stuff that is left by
careless cooks lying about. In this she
puts her eggs, and then she dies. Little
grubs are born from them.</p>

<p>4. "They begin to eat as soon as they
are born, and very soon they turn into flies,
after going to sleep for a while first in a kind
of little hard skin or shell. They change
into flies while they are inside this shell."</p>

<p>5. "What do the flies do when they
cannot find any dirty rubbish?" said Rose.</p>

<p>"Then they go to look for it in other
places," said her granny. "So you see, if
we do not wish to have flies in our houses
we must have no rubbish."</p>

<p>6. "Then the flies are little servants to
us, granny?"</p>

<p>"Yes, to be sure."</p>

<p>"I wish I could see a baby-fly," said
Rose.</p>

<p>7. "You would not think it at all pretty,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
said Mrs. Sutton. "It is a whitish maggot.
But some ugly looking things are very useful
to us."</p>

<p>"I like pretty things best," said Rose.</p>

<p>8. "Well, the fly is pretty enough when
he is grown up. He has to wait, you see."
I was pleased to hear the kind old lady say
this, and I nodded my head and washed
my face with my feet.</p>

<p>9. "And so it is your birthday on Monday,
Rose," went on her granny. "And
I suppose it is time to be thinking about
the party and the fun we are to have?"</p>

<p>10. Rose looked up, beaming with delight
at these words. Though she had not
been born as a grub in a sink, I thought
that she looked pretty too.</p>

<p>11. "We must get Miss Bush to write
the letters for us, Rose, and ask the little
girls, and boys to come and spend the day
with you. Run now and see if she will be
so good as to do it now."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well," said Rose. And she
went out with a skip.</p>

<p><i>Write:</i> A house-fly is born in the sink.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>

wish to have many flies, what must we do? 6. What treat was
Rose going to have?</p></blockquote>


<h3>8. SAVED AGAIN.</h3>

<p>1. I heard a little girl say, "Oh, Rose,
there is a fly in your glass of wine."</p>

<p>"Poor thing!" said the little girl next
her, "take it out!"</p>

<p>"No, no!" said her brother; "let it
alone. Let us see how he swims."</p>

<p>2. All this time I felt very bad. I was
drowning, yet this boy could look on and
talk like that.</p>

<p>3. Something seemed to take away all
my breath and strength. I heard the boy
say, "If I fell into a pond I could not
swim so well."</p>

<p>4. "Why, no," said Rose, "the fly has not
a coat and trousers, as you have. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
I do not think it is fun to see him drowning,
so I will take him out." And she pushed
the handle of a spoon with care under
me.</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 473px;">
<img src="images/image023.png" width="473" height="450" alt="" title="" />
</p>

<p>5. I could hardly crawl when I got on
to the table-cloth. She saw it and placed
me on a green laurel leaf outside. I sat
there half dead, and yet I heard what they
were all saying inside the summer-house.</p>

<p>6. "Lucy," said Rose to the little girl,
"you would have been glad if you could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
have been lifted out like that poor fly,
when you fell into the pond at home, would
you not?</p>

<p>7. "You went to the bottom before any
person came to help you. Were you in a
great fright? How did you feel?"</p>

<p>8. "Why," said Lucy, "I was in a great
fright when I first fell in, but after that I
think that I must have been asleep, for I
forgot it all. I knew nothing after my
tumble down the bank, till I heard my
mother near me.</p>

<p>9. "She was saying, 'God bless you,
darling,' and then I found myself lying in
bed."</p>

<p>"Ah," said her brother Tom, "Neptune,
our dog, had a famous supper that night."</p>

<p>10. "Why?" asked a little boy, from
the other end of the table.</p>

<p>"Oh, did you not know that it was
Neptune who pulled my sister out of the
water?" said Tom.</p>

<p>11. "He saw her go in, and without
being told, he got her out. She would
have been drowned without him. She had
been told not to go near the pond, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
she ran down to it, without leave, when no
one was looking."</p>

<p>12. The other little girl here grew very
red. "You need not have said that, Tom,"
said she. But Tom was a bit of a tease.
He only laughed and said that his sister
was always doing what she was told not.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

glass. She put him on a leaf to get dry.

saved Lucy's life?</p></blockquote>


<h3>9. GRANNY'S CAP ON FIRE.</h3>

<p>1. I did not feel much desire to taste
any food next morning. The long swim
on the day before had taken away my wish
for eating and drinking.</p>

<p>2. I nearly flew down to the flower
which Rose had put in water, but I changed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
my mind. On the whole I prefer the smell
of jam to that of roses.</p>

<p>3. I felt that a little walk would do me
good, so I went round the tray once or
twice, and then I tried to do the same
thing on the tea-urn, but it was too hot
for my feet.</p>

<p>4. I left that quickly enough, and after
running across the toast on Mr. Sutton's
plate, and crawling up his paper, only to
be driven away, I went to the window.</p>

<p>5. Here I was so lucky as to meet a few
of my friends, and we had a little dance in
the sunshine, which quite brought back my
health and spirits.</p>

<p>6. The day thus passed by, and it was
very warm indeed later on. After tea Mr.
and Mrs. Sutton were seated in the drawing-room,
one on each side of a little table,
with a candle between them.</p>

<p>7. The old lady was knitting, and her
husband was reading aloud the paper to
her. I think he was reading to amuse
himself more than his wife.</p>

<p>8. I could feel, as I sat on her cap, that
her head was nodding now and then, as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
she were dozing. Mr. Sutton at last saw
this. And laying down the paper he said,
two or three times, "You are sleepy, my
dear."</p>

<p>9. Each time that he said this, granny
woke up, sat very upright, and said, "Oh
no, not at all, my love." But she went off
again to sleep as soon as the reading
began.</p>

<p>10. At length she was in so sound a nap
that she did not notice when Mr. Sutton
put down the paper, after reading a long,
dull account of something or other.</p>

<p>11. He took off his glasses, laid them on
the folded paper, and saying something to
himself about resting his eyes, fell fast
asleep too.</p>

<p>12. Granny's head now nodded lower
and lower. First she gave a nod, and
then her husband gave a bow, just as if
they were being most polite to each other
in their sleep.</p>

<p>13. Her cap was very near the wax
candle once or twice, and there was a
smell of burning. She now began to nod
sideways, and each time that she did so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
there was a great smoke and a frizzling
noise.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p><i>Write:</i> Rose went to spend the day with
Lucy. The fly sat on the cap of the old
lady. She fell asleep and the cap caught
on fire.</p>

<blockquote><p>Questions: 1. Where did Rose go? 2. Where did the fly stay?
3. What were Mr. and Mrs. Sutton doing that evening? 4. What
did Mr. Sutton say when his wife's head nodded? 5. What did
he do himself? 6. What happened to the old lady's cap?</p></blockquote>


<h3>10. A NARROW ESCAPE.</h3>

<p>1. I was afraid of losing my perch, her
nice white cap, on which I had now grown
to feel quite at home. It seemed as if it
were turning into ashes like those in the
grate, and it felt too hot.</p>

<p>2. I flew up, for I could sit there no
longer. And then I pitched on the top of
Mr. Sutton's head, just in the bald place,
and stamped with one foot as hard as I
could.</p>

<p>3. I also ran about and tickled him a
good deal. He woke up in a great hurry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
for he raised his hand to drive me away,
and in doing so, gave himself a smart tap.</p>

<p>4. This roused him. And he awoke
just in time to save the cap and the hair
of his wife from being in a blaze of fire.</p>

<p>5. "Dear, dear, dear!" said he. "Why,
my love, what an escape you have had!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense, my dear," said the old lady,
"I have not been asleep, I assure you."
But it was of no use for her to say and
think this.</p>

<p>6. There was the burnt cap on her head.
"I was not quite asleep," said she. "Oh
no, neither was I," said her husband,
laughing.</p>

<p>7. And then, looking grave, he said,
"You were in great danger though, my
dear. I read only a day or two ago, of
an old lady who had been burnt to death
from setting her cap on fire."</p>

<p>8. I had been in great danger too, though
no one seemed to think of that. What
between the flames, and the knock that
Mr. Sutton aimed at me, I might have
been killed.</p>

<p>9. Thomas was now heard coming up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
gravel walk. He had been sent to fetch
Rose home. She was full of news to tell,
about all the things she had seen and
heard that day.</p>

<p>10. "It is a great mercy, my dear, that
you have a bit of your granny left," said
Mr. Sutton. "If it had not been for a
fly, which tickled the top of my head,
your granny's cap would have been on
fire."</p>

<p>11. "Well, well, Mr. Sutton," said the
old lady, who, somehow or other, did not
seem to like hearing about the cap being
on fire.</p>

<p>12. "You see here I am, without even
being singed. And I was not half so sound
asleep as you were, my dear. Depend
upon it I am too old and too wise to let
my cap catch fire."</p>

<p>13. Mr. Sutton did not say any more
about the cap, since it seemed to vex his
wife.</p>

<p>"Ah," said Rose, "if I had been at
home you would not both have fallen
asleep."</p>

<p>14. "That is very likely," said granny,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
smiling. "Well, and how did you enjoy
yourself?" Rose said that she had been
very happy.</p>

<p>15. She had seen Neptune dive, and
she had been drenched by the shaking
which the big doggie gave himself when
he came out of the water.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p><i>Write:</i> The fly pitched on the head of
the old man. He gave a stamp with his
foot to wake him up. The old man put
out the fire.</p>

<blockquote><p>Questions: 1. Where did the fly pitch on leaving the cap?
2. What did he do to the old man's head? 3. What did Mr.
Sutton do when he woke up? 4. What did he say to his wife?
5. Who came home with Thomas? 6. What sort of day had
Rose spent?</p></blockquote>


<h3>11. A GLASS TO MAKE THINGS BIG.</h3>

<p>1. "What shall I look at next?" said
Rose, who had a glass thing in her hand,
next day. "Oh, this fly!"</p>

<p>2. The lunch was on the table, and I
was just making a hearty meal on a pat
of butter. I knew that Rose would not
hurt me. So I stood quite still.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>3. "How very strange!" said the little
girl. "He looks as big as a horse. His
wings are like shining lace, and he has
hairy brushes on his feet.</p>

<p>4. "Now he is cleaning his head with
one of them. I am glad that flies are not
really so big as he seems now.</p>

<p>5. "What a buzzing we should have,
and what should we do when such huge
things flew about the room or walked on
the ceiling!</p>

<p>6. "There would be no room for us to
move, and the house would be too small.
Fancy having such a creature as this fly
looks now jumping and prancing over one's
bread and jam!"</p>

<p>7. I was not pleased with this speech;
I knew that my colour was rather dingy,
but I had always thought my shape to be
light and graceful, and this Rose had taken
no notice of.</p>

<p>8. Neither had she so much as looked at
my trunk, of which I am truly proud. So
I flew away in a pet from under the glass,
and settled on the loaf in the middle of
the table, out of her reach.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>9. "But for you, dear grand-father, I
should never have thought such tiny creatures
worth taking any notice of. Why,
they are made just as well as big ones, or
better."</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption">WHAT SHALL I LOOK AT NEXT?</span>
</p>

<p>10. "Not better, dear, but quite as
well. They are all the work of God's
hand, and so all must be alike good. Do
you know that you owe the pretty crimson
sash that you have on to a very little
creature?"</p>

<p>11. "Oh yes, the silkworm," said Rose.</p>

<p>"Yes, and the red colour was made from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
the dead body of an insect too. There is
a sort of blight which gives this red colour
after it is dead.</p>

<p>12. "Merchants bring them from
abroad, after they have been taken from
the plants on which they live. As they
kill the coffee plants they must be swept
off, and they are made into dye."</p>

<p>13. Grand-father would have said much
more, but just then Rose saw Tom and
Lucy walking up the lawn to the open
window.</p>

<p>14. Behind them walked gravely Neptune
the dog, with his master's stick in his
mouth, which he thought it a great honour
to carry.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p><i>Write:</i> Rose saw the fly through her
glass. She felt glad that the fly was not
so big as he looked then. He was as well
made as if he were large.</p>

<blockquote><p>Questions: 1. What did Rose look at through her glass?
2. What did she think about the fly? 3. What did Mr. Sutton
say about great and little creatures? 4. Whom did Rose see
in the garden? 5. Who walked behind carrying his master's
stick?</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>


<h3>12. A LONG SLEEP.</h3>

<p>1. About this time I began to feel a chill
in the air. I did not like this, for it made
me feel drowsy. So I kept in the warmth
of the drawing-room all day.</p>

<p>2. But I was shocked to see that many
of my friends began to get quite unfit to
run or fly about. Their wings seemed
heavy, and some of them crept into holes
where they went to sleep.</p>

<p>3. One day I went down to the table
and found one of the gayest flies I had
ever known, lying on his back upon the
cloth.</p>

<p>4. He was cold and stiff. Nearly all
the friends I had made that summer were
dying or dead around me, or else they
had crept into corners out of sight.</p>

<p>5. I knew that something must be done,
or I too should one day be found lying on
my back with my legs in the air, and
Thomas would sweep me away, as he did
the other flies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>6. I made up my mind to choose the
best place I could, and there seemed none
better than the old red curtain from which
I had first come out into that pleasant
room.</p>

<p>7. I therefore ran about on the wall
behind it for some time, looking for a
proper hole. I found just the nook I
wanted, where a bit of the wall paper
was peeling off.</p>

<p>8. I had hardly crept into it when I was
fast asleep. To my good sense and
quickness I owe my life. If I had not been
a clever fly, I should have died, I dare
say, like the rest.</p>

<p>9. As it is, here I am, alive and merry.
When I woke the next warm spring day,
there was little Rose and Mr. and Mrs.
Sutton sitting at breakfast just as they
had done when first I saw them.</p>

<p>10. Rose was perhaps a little taller, and
the bald place on her grand-father's head
may have been a wee bit wider.</p>

<p>11. But the jam was just as good, the
honey and sugar as sweet, and the white
cap just as clean and nice to sit on. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
flowers in the garden, too, smell as fresh
as ever&mdash;still I prefer the jam.</p>

<p>12. If I might say one word at parting,
it would be this. Do not forget that there
is room in this big wide world for a poor
little fly as well as for boys and girls.</p>

<p>13. And if you enjoy life and like a
good game at play,&mdash;why, so do we! So
let us have our harmless games and do
our tiny bit of work for you in peace.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<h2><a name="BETTY_AND_SNOWDROP" id="BETTY_AND_SNOWDROP"></a>BETTY AND SNOWDROP.</h2>


<h3>1. PEEP! PEEP!</h3>

<p>1. There was once a young hen. She
had led a very quiet life in a village until
she was nearly one year old. Then, all at
once, she found that people began to make
a great fuss about her.</p>

<p>2. You will never guess why, and so, as
I think you may like to hear all about her,
I will begin at once and tell you. Betty,&mdash;that
was the name of this hen,&mdash;was
one of ten fluffy little yellow chicks.</p>

<p>3. She was dressed in soft bright down
when she first crept out of her egg-shell.
She had a sharp beak and bright clever
black eyes.</p>

<p>4. One morning, as her mother was strutting
about the yard with all her children
behind her, crying "cluck, cluck!" as she
scratched up bits for them among the straw,
Gip, the little pet dog, ran up.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>5. He was only a puppy, and he meant
nothing but play. Perhaps he mistook the
small round chicks for a lot of little balls
rolling about. At any rate he snatched up
Betty, who was the finest of them, in his
mouth.</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/image025.png" width="600" height="369" alt="THE FARMYARD." title="THE FARMYARD." />
<span class="caption">THE FARMYARD.</span>
</p>

<p>6. With a roguish look at their fat old
mother, he began to scamper off with her.
"Cackle, cackle!" screamed the old hen.
"Put the baby down this moment, sir!"
And the mother flew at Gip before he had
gone six yards.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>7. She jumped upon his back, and began
to flap his head with her wings as hard as
she could, while she made digs at his back
with her beak.</p>

<p>8. The pretty dog, finding himself treated
in this way, soon dropped the chicken out
of his mouth. Little Betty rolled out from
between his white teeth and fell flop! to
the ground.</p>

<p>9. She was not a bit hurt, for she toddled
back to join her brothers and sisters, who
were all crying "peep! peep!" in a great
fright. They were afraid of seeing her
eaten up alive.</p>

<p>10. But though her child was none the
worse, the mother-hen began to batter and
beat poor Gip as if he had maimed it for
life. And she never forgave the little dog
after that day.</p>

<p>11. When she saw him coming, even at
a distance, she pushed out her head, stuck
all her feathers on end, and spread out her
tail like a bush.</p>

<p>12. Perhaps it was the dreadful fright
which Betty felt while she was in the jaws
of Gip, which made her so grave and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
thoughtful a chicken as she soon became.
She walked better than the rest.</p>

<p>13. She held herself upright, and her
mother was never heard to say, "heads
up!" as she did to the other chickens.
Her mistress said one morning that Betty
was "the pride of the brood."</p>

<p>14. Her two brothers were very greedy
chickens, I am sorry to say. And as they
grew older, they began to fight sadly for
each worm or grain of corn which they
found.</p>

<p>15. Though Betty and the rest of the
chickens grew up white as snow, one of
these young cocks had a speckled breast,
and the other had two black feathers in his
tail. This spoilt their look.</p>

<p>16. They were both taken away one day
by a strange man, in spite of all that their
mother could say. She bustled up and
tried to rescue her sons. Although they
were both in the habit of eating too much,
she loved them in spite of all.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p><i>Write:</i> A little chick was picked up by
a puppy. He did not kill it, but put it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
down when the hen came after him. The
chicken was not hurt.</p>

<blockquote><p>Questions: 1. How many brothers and sisters had Betty?
2. What did the puppy do one day? 3. What did the old hen
do? 4. What did Betty's mistress call her? 5. What sort of
chickens were the two brothers? 6. What became of them?</p></blockquote>


<h3>2. BETTY IS SPOILT.</h3>

<p>1. Time passed on, and Betty grew fast
in size and beauty. Her mistress made
up her mind to send her to the Poultry
Show at the Crystal Palace.</p>

<p>2. The cook and all who saw her said
that Betty ought to go, her beauty was
so great. She was quite a perfect pattern
of what a white hen of her sort ought to
be.</p>

<p>3. She would be certain to win a first
prize of the first class, they all thought.
Poor Betty! From the day that it was
settled for her to go to the Poultry Show
her troubles began.</p>

<p>4. When first it was made known in
the yard she became rather vain, in spite
of all that her mother could say. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
fact was that the old hen felt proud of it
herself, and Betty knew it.</p>

<p>5. She would be always pluming the
feathers of her daughter, cackling loudly,
and calling to strange chickens to come
and admire the lovely back and smooth
wings of her child.</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 341px;">
<img src="images/image026.png" width="341" height="450" alt="COCK-A-DOODLE-DO!" title="COCK-A-DOODLE-DO!" />
<span class="caption">COCK-A-DOODLE-DO!</span>
</p>

<p>6. The young cocks from next door
sat on the railings to chatter, and even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
forgot to quarrel. They stared at Miss
Betty as she walked with her beak in the
air, and they made rude remarks.</p>

<p>7. "Why don't you grow a pair of spurs
and learn to crow?" they called out. When
Mrs. Dorking, Betty's mother, heard these
speeches from the young cocks she flew
into a great passion.</p>

<p>8. "I will set the dog at you, you young
scamps, if you do not be off this moment,"
cried she. So they dropped off one by
one, for they did not know that the old
hen was not able to carry out her threat.</p>

<p>9. As Betty became vain she became
idle too. Instead of making her mother
and sisters happy with her pretty playful
ways, and making herself useful and
pleasant at home, she grew pettish.</p>

<p>10. And instead of working to help
earn her own living, by catching flies,
scratching up worms, and watching under
the old oak tree for cock-chafers, she
would lose patience, and call loudly to the
cook to bring her food.</p>

<p>11. And, strange to say, the cook would
come too, and, not content with waiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
on Betty, would drive away each fowl and
chick that came up to share what she had
brought.</p>

<p>12. She let none of them have a bit till
Betty had eaten all that she pleased. Was
not this enough to spoil any young hen?
Betty was fast getting pert. All this was
because of her good looks and her five
toes.</p>

<p>13. You will see after a while that she
would have been more happy if she had
been born ugly, or with four toes, like her
sisters.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p><i>Write:</i> Betty was to go to a show.
She grew vain when she heard this. And
as she became vain she grew idle too.
She was spoilt.</p>

<blockquote><p>Questions: 1. Where did Betty's mistress think of sending
her? 2. What did they all think that she would get at the show?
3. What made her grow proud? 4. What did she do instead of
earning her living? 5. What did the young cocks say? 6. What
answer did the old hen make to them?</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>


<h3>3. SOAP AND WATER.</h3>

<p>1. After a little more time had passed,
Betty was taken out of the yard. They
did not let her stay with her sisters and
the other fowls any longer, but she was
placed in a large room by herself.</p>

<p>2. Here she was fed on all sorts of
dainties. She had chestnuts, minced liver,
new milk, and fresh lettuce. Life was
now a feast to Betty, but she found it
rather dull.</p>

<p>3. "I would rather have one worm or a
spider," said she, with a sigh. How she
longed for a good scamper with her
sisters! "I am sure that we should never
squabble now," said the poor, lonely little
thing.</p>

<p>4. But this time alone did not last long.
One morning a worse thing was done to
her. She was taken by the cook and
plunged into a warm bath. It was not
of the least use for her to kick and
scream.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>5. The cook did not care. She rubbed
Betty gently with a soaped flannel, talking
to her in a soothing way all the time, and
then set her down before the fire to dry.</p>

<p>6. But Betty's fright was soon over, and
she was not at
all hurt, of
course. Yet
she might have
caught her
death of cold,
and all this because
of the
show! that her
feathers might
look fine.</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 368px;">
<img src="images/image027.png" width="368" height="450" alt="A WARM BATH." title="A WARM BATH." />
<span class="caption">A WARM BATH.</span>
</p>

<p>7. If the cook
had let Betty
alone to clean
them, she would have done it better.
The soap was bad for them, so was the
water.</p>

<p>8. Betty felt very pleased when the
cook went to call all the other servants.
She wished them to admire the snowy
whiteness of her feathers. "If she does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
not win a first prize I will eat my head!"
said the cook.</p>

<p>9. "You will have a fine big meal, then,"
said the housemaid, "and I should not
wonder if you have not spoilt her feathers
for ever by washing them. You never
ought to have done it, and the poor thing
may get ill."</p>

<p>10. But thanks to the care taken of her,
Betty did not get ill, though the nasty
soap made her feel sick; and the cook
saw that she had made a mistake in washing
Betty.</p>

<p>11. "All creatures can clean themselves,"
said the housemaid, "leastways
all birds can, at any rate, and we do
harm by meddling."</p>

<p>12. "I think we ought to keep her
under a wash-tub or in a basket until the
day for the show," said the cook. "She
will be sure to get dirty again in that
barn."</p>

<p>13. When a nice new hen-coop was
turned over her, Betty began to think
about her mother. "What a horrid time
she must have spent when we were little,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
and she had to stay in a coop!" said the
young hen to herself.</p>

<p>14. "And yet I think that I am even
worse off than she was, for I have to stay
here without any little chickens to amuse
me, or to run under my wings."</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p><i>Write:</i> The young hen was washed.
It was bad for her and made her feathers
rough. She grew tired of being shut up
though she was well fed.</p>

<blockquote><p>Questions: 1. Where was Betty placed alone? 2. What did
she say to herself about her food? 3. What did the cook do to
her? 4. What did the housemaid tell her? 5. Where was
Betty put next? 6. What did she think about in the coop?</p></blockquote>


<h3>4. AT THE SHOW.</h3>

<p>1. "No, I have nothing to amuse me,"
said Betty, "but the thought of how handsome
I am. It is nice to think of that,
and yet I am almost tired of hearing it."</p>

<p>2. Betty would have given one of the
best feathers in her tail for a good race
after a beetle, or for a good scratch for
grubs down by the manure heap, which
was the best place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>3. But she had hardly yet begun her
trials. On the next day, the coachman took
her in a hamper to the show. Betty
screamed as she was put into it, for she
did not like it at all.</p>

<p>4. "I will behave well, no matter what
happens," said poor Betty. But she felt
afraid of the noise, the pushing, and the
crowd of people and poultry at the Palace.</p>

<p>5. There were Spanish cocks and hens,
who were lofty and silent. There were
little silver bantams who chuckled. Some
hens were tiny dwarfs like the bantams,
others were giants like the Cochin China
fowls.</p>

<p>6. There were gamecocks, too, looking
like fierce soldiers. Among all the smart
poultry Betty found herself passed over
and called "only a pullet."</p>

<p>7. All the other fowls were called
"loves" and "dears," while hardly any
people took notice of her plain white dress
and rosy head-dress. But one gentle lady
came by, who stopped near Betty.</p>

<p>8. She pointed Betty out to a child who
was with her, saying that she was one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
the best hens of her kind which she had
ever seen.</p>

<p>9. The lady added, "No fowls lay better
eggs than these pretty Dorkings.</p>

<p>"They make the best mothers, they are
English in their habits, and therefore
stronger than birds from foreign lands."</p>

</p>

<p>10. The air at the Crystal Palace was
hot and close. Betty began to wish herself
at home again. She could not eat,
though food was there.</p>

<p>11. And though her feathers were all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
ruffled and in a mess, she did not feel able
to put them to rights. Yet she knew that
she ought to tidy herself.</p>

<p>12. One of the hens near began to mock
at her. She said with a pretence of being
polite: "May I put your tail tidy for you,
madam, since it seems too much trouble
for you to do it yourself?"</p>

<p>13. And then the sly thing gave a
tweak and pulled out Betty's longest
feather.</p>

<p>14. A hen near gave a dab with her
beak at Betty's pink comb, and made it
bleed. And though she said after that
she did not mean to hurt her, that did not
heal the sore place.</p>

<h3>5. A SAD MISHAP.</h3>

<p>1. After a time Betty felt better. The
other fowls left off teasing her. They had
only been in rough play, and did not mean
to worry her too much.</p>

<p>2. She dipped her bill into a dish of
water which was there, picked a bit of
lettuce, and said to herself that she would
make the best of a bad job.</p>

<p>3. Betty was still as vain of having five
toes on each foot as any fine young lady
could be of wearing new shoes. She was
always holding up one foot or else the
other. No doubt she meant to show off.</p>

<p>4. There was a great cackling and noise
in some of the pens after a while, and
Betty heard that the judges were coming.
These were the people who were to give
the prizes, and she felt now more vain than
ever.</p>

<p>5. She made up her mind to present her
foot to the judges, and even to push it out
between the wires of her pen, as far as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
could. "They cannot help giving me a
prize when they see my five toes!" she
said to herself.</p>

<p>6. But just as she had thrust her toe
right out between the wires, after much
trouble, she heard an odd voice from the
next pen say, "Hullo, what's that? Is it a
grub?"</p>

<p>7. A queer big bird with a long neck
had caught sight of the foot, and he gave a
great snap at it as he saw it move. Betty
tried to pull her toes back, but the big bird
would not let go.</p>

<p>8. At last it ended by his pecking off
the nail and first joint of poor Betty's
middle claw. She was in much pain and
screamed loudly.</p>

<p>9. Up rushed a man, the keeper, who
took Betty out in a great hurry. "We
must have no wounded or sick birds here
for the judges to see," he said.</p>

<p>10. And he put poor Betty quickly
away into one of the pens which had been
used for bringing fowls to the show. It
was empty but for two or three poor hens
who were either dead or dying.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>11. These were fowls which had been
hurt on the way, by being shaken or
roughly used. They had been put into
baskets too small for them, or had been
badly used in some other way. It is bad
for birds to travel.</p>

<p>12. Here Betty sank down on the
ground. At first she could do nothing
but think of her poor toe; she
pushed it into some soft stuff which lay on
the floor, and this stopped the bleeding.</p>

<p>13. How sad she felt! All her fine
hopes of a prize were gone. She was a
cripple now for life, and no one would care
for her fine looks any more.</p>

<p>14. "I wonder what is the use of
shows?" thought Betty. "Why do people
want other people to tell them that their
cocks and hens are pretty?"</p>

<p>15. After the bustle and fuss of the day
were over, one of the keepers came with a
boy to look after the dead and dying.</p>

<p>16. "She was as great a beauty as ever
I did see," said the man. "A perfect pullet!&mdash;that
she was. But, dear me! she is not
perfect now that her toe is gone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>17. "She is good for nothing now but to
lay eggs and bring up chicks. She was
worth a couple of pounds; now she would
only fetch a couple of shillings.</p>

<p>18. "Here, Jack, tie a bit of rag round
the stump, and give her food and water in
that spare box. I cannot bear to wring
her neck, as we are forced to do with
many, to put them out of pain."</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

off. She was put into a place out of sight.

<h3>6. A NEW HOME.</h3>

<p>1. Poor Betty had plenty of time to
think over all her troubles. But after two
or three days she heard a sound which
made her feel very happy.</p>

<p>2. It was the voice of her old friend the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
coachman, who had come to fetch her
away. She cackled to him in a most
loving way; but, alas! the coachman had
nothing to say to her.</p>

<span class="caption">THE NEW HOME.</span>
</p>

<p>3. He was cross and sulky because
Betty had not won a prize.</p>

<p>"Poor thing!" said the cook when Betty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
got home, "what an object she looks to be
sure! She is as light as a feather.</p>

<p>4. "The mother that hatched her won't
know her again. I declare that I don't
believe this is our Betty at all, but some
old rubbish of a bird they have sent us
instead!"</p>

<p>5. "Oh yes," said her mistress, coming
up to look, "it is our Betty. But I beg
of you to get rid of her at once. I cannot
bear the sight of her after thinking she
would get a prize."</p>

<p>6. "Shall I step out and do it at once?"
said the cook, calmly.</p>

<p>"No, no!" said the mistress. "Do not
kill her. Give her away. She will be a
useful hen to some one else, and is sure to
lay plenty of eggs."</p>

<p>"Very good, ma'am," replied the cook.</p>

<p>7. There was no washing this time before
Betty was sent away. That was one comfort.
She was huddled, just as she was,
into a hamper, and sent as a present to a
friend of the cook.</p>

<p>8. This friend was the wife of a farmer,
and she was such a kind, good, rosy, happy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
pleasant woman, that it was quite a treat
to look at her. She lived about five miles
from Betty's old home.</p>

<p>9. The large farm-yard into which Betty
now stepped from her hamper, was like a
new world to her. She began at once to
dig with those of her sharp claws which
were left.</p>

<p>10. And finding chalk like that which
had been under the soil at home, she
nodded her head and chuckled, for she
was pleased. No hen can be happy without
chalk, after she is old enough to lay
eggs.</p>

<p>11. She knew that the yard in which
she now was, would be a fine place for
her young brood. They would not be
likely to get the cramp or catch colds.</p>

<p>12. The fowl-house was built on a gentle
slope, and below, at some little distance,
was a pond with two or three green islands
in the middle of it. Here some water
birds, such as Betty had never seen before,
were paddling about.</p>

<p>13. She could not think how they did it.
The yard had good shelter from rough,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
cold winds, for a fir wood was at the back
of it. And the houses for cattle and horses
stood with their backs to it on two sides.</p>

<p>14. The houses where the hens were to
sit on their eggs, were sprinkled with chalk
laid over dry coal ashes. This was to keep
the floor clean and wholesome.</p>

<p>They were swept out often. The
perches for roosting were not thin sticks,
but nice stout boughs of trees, so that the
feet could clasp them without slipping.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p><i>Write:</i> The new home to which Betty
was sent pleased her. She thought that
she should soon forget her sorrows. The

woman was the farmer's wife? 3. When Betty stepped out of
her hamper what did she begin to do? 4. What did she find?

<h3>7. TWELVE LITTLE CHICKS.</h3>

<p>1. Her friends at the old home had all
walked on dry land. But here she found
many ducks and drakes, besides odd-looking
fowls with feathers down their legs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>2. Spring came, and Betty paced the
yard with twelve fine chickens behind her.
All of them had five toes on each little
foot, as their mother had when she was
born. So they were all right.</p>

<p>3. Down the velvet back of each chick
were stripes of dark brown, which was the
proper pattern for their first short coats.
After a time they would put off baby-clothes,
and be dressed in pure white like
their mother.</p>

<p>4. As her chicks slept under her wings,
or chirped with their merry little voices,
she forgot all else but her darlings. What
did it matter having one claw too few,
now that she had her dear babies?</p>

<p>5. Betty took care to keep her children
neat, and to teach them good manners.
"You may gobble up a worm, children,
as fast as you like, when you find it, so
that no one else may get it," said she.</p>

<p>6. "But don't let me see two of you
having a fight, or both tugging at the
same worm. You must not ruffle up
your feathers at each other, or fight,
though you may do so if you meet a rat."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>7. As Betty was such an anxious and
watchful mother herself, she could not help
feeling quite vexed at the way in which
Snowdrop, one of the ducks, went on.</p>

<p>8. This big white duck did not seem to
mind a bit whether her children were a
credit to her or not. "See!" said this
good hen, pointing to her twelve clean
little chicks. "Where will you find such
children as mine?</p>

<p>9. "I spend all my time in teaching them
how to behave themselves. I show them
how to walk nicely, and how to pick up
their meals in a proper way.</p>

<p>10. "I show them how to keep their
feathers combed and brushed. But you,
bad mother that you are, allow your poor
little yellow ducklings to shuffle in the
mud up to their wings.</p>

<p>11. "And twice I have seen them at the
very edge of the pond. It made me
shudder! It will be a wonder if they
do not get drowned, or catch their death
of cold. How thin and pale they look!"</p>

<p>12. As Betty said these words to Snowdrop,
the old duck shook her bill, and after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
a few more quacks turned her back and
waddled off.</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 579px;">

<span class="caption">BETTY&#39;S CHICKS.</span>
</p>

<p>13. Soon after this, a magpie came down
to tell all the fowls in the yard that one of
Snowdrop's ducklings had been eaten by a
rat, and that a second had been stolen by
a hawk.</p>

<p>14. Two more of them had run away
under the gate and had strayed towards a
tent where some gipsies lived. As they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
never came back, it was thought that the
gipsies had taken them off.</p>

<p>15. A fifth of the brood, which had been
weakly from birth, had caught cold in a
bitter wind and died. And the last had
pined away from feeling lonely after
losing all its brothers and sisters.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p><i>Write:</i> The hen had now twelve chicks.
She took more care of her children than

a bad mother.</p>

yard? 2. How many chickens had she? 3. What did she
teach them? 4. What was the name of the duck? 5. What
sort of mother was she? 6. What did Betty say to her?</p></blockquote>


<h3>8. A VISIT TO SNOWDROP.</h3>

<p>1. As Betty's brood was now grown
old enough to go into the world, she had
plenty of time to pay Snowdrop a visit.
So she went off one fine morning and
found her near the brink of the pond.</p>

<p>2. Snowdrop was using her orange bill
as a shovel to catch leeches in the mud.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
Betty told her that she had come to have
a chat with her. She wished to speak
about the way in which she had brought
up her children.</p>

<p>3. "I am sure, my dear Snowdrop,"
said Betty, "that cold water was the
death of all your lost ducklings, no matter
what you or any other bird may say.</p>

<p>4. "You are a strong duck, and so it
has not hurt you yet. But you see that
your frail little ones are all gone. It is
all through your careless habit of letting
them dabble in the mud all day and get
their feet wet."</p>

<p>5. "Nonsense!" said Snowdrop, as, with
an eye dark and bright as that of Betty,
she glanced at her own orange legs and
webbed feet.</p>

<p>6. "Nonsense! It is all nature, and runs
in the blood," she said. "My mother
before me, and her mother before that,
knew that water never hurts a duck. It
hurts us to be kept dry!</p>

<p>7. "And as for catching cold or getting
fits, or cramp, or the pip&mdash;can you do
this?" And as she spoke, Snowdrop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
waddled down the steepest part of the
bank.</p>

<p>8. She set her breast for a moment
against the tiny ripples of the pond until
she was in water deep enough to swim in.
Then, all of a sudden, she turned herself
upside down.</p>

<p>9. Her head went below, and nothing
of her could be seen above but a tail, and
two yellow legs. She stayed so long like
this, grubbing for water-snails, that Betty
began to fear she should never see her
head again.</p>

<p>10. But she popped it out again in a few
minutes, and came sailing with a saucy
quack back again to the bank. "Do I
look any the worse?" said she.</p>

<p>11. Betty held her tongue. She still
thought, as she had done before, that no
matter what Snowdrop did, cold water was
bad for ducklings.</p>

<p>12. A young Bantam hen, who was
standing by, said to Betty, "Where can
you have come from, and what sort of egg
did you creep out of, not to have seen a
duck swim before?" said the Bantam.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>13. "All the yard knows that they are
the best sailors in the world! But for you
and me, our ruffles are too well starched
for such a way of life."</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/image031.png" width="600" height="420" alt="UPSIDE DOWN." title="UPSIDE DOWN." />
<span class="caption">UPSIDE DOWN.</span>
</p>

<p>14. Here was a new wonder to Betty.
Though a shower of rain soaked all her fine
feathers through, and made them limp as
old rags, Snowdrop came out of the pond
dry and warm, her plumes crisp and
neat.</p>

<p>15. Not a trace of water was to be seen
on her. Well, to be sure! Betty could
not make it out. After all there must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
a thing or two which even the wisest hen
does not know.</p>

<p>16. "I advise you to carry oil in your
feathers when you learn to swim," said
Snowdrop, as she skimmed off again over
the pond. "That is my plan, but ducks
are too wise to boast about it."</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p><i>Write:</i> Betty went to see the duck.
She felt much surprise at seeing her swim
and dive. But she still thought that water
was not good for ducklings.</p>

<blockquote><p>Questions: 1. Where did Betty find Snowdrop? 2. What
did Betty say to her? 3. What did the Bantam hen say?
4. What did Snowdrop do to show Betty? 5. What did Betty
still think about ducklings? 6. How was it that the duck's
feathers were not wet?</p></blockquote>


<h3>9. SNOWDROP'S NEST.</h3>

<p>1. Weeks went by. Snowdrop thought
that it was time for her to bring some more
little ducklings into the world, instead of
those which she had lost.</p>

<p>2. So, down among the green rushes at
the very brink of the pond, she made a
nest. It was not much more than a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
bundle of straws which the wind had
swept into that place but it did very
well.</p>

<p>3. Snowdrop had poked the straws into
a heap with her beak. She trod them
down with her feet, made a round hole
with her breast in the middle, and put a
few feathers inside.</p>

<p>4. In this rough nest she laid seven pale
green eggs, and very pretty they looked.
Betty no sooner heard of this, than she ran
as fast as she could to the spot. She had
a kind thought in her head.</p>

<p>5. She had now no little ones of her
own; and somehow, though she laid an egg
each day in the wicker nest, it was always
gone before night. So she had nothing to
sit on.</p>

<p>6. And so it had come into her good
heart that she would offer to sit on Snowdrop's
eggs for her. "I promise you to
do it well," said she to the duck.</p>

<p>7. "If you trust me with your eggs I
will treat them just as if they were my
own. And when the young are hatched
I will nurse the dear little things, teach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
them, and bring them up better than you
could do yourself."</p>

<p>8. The duck, who just then saw her
drake bowing his head to her as he swam
along, thought that she would like to join
him on the pond.</p>

<p>9. Snowdrop loved pleasure. Why
should she sit cooped up on a nest for
four weeks, when she might be having fun
on the pond? Betty was willing to do it
for her.</p>

<p>10. She liked hunting for slugs and
worms, or swimming races with her drake,
better than sitting still. So she said
"yes" to Betty's offer and marched off.</p>

<p>11. The good little hen climbed as well
as she could on to the nest; but she did
not half like the look of it. Why, the eggs
were ready to roll out at the sides! And
her body was not so big as that of Snowdrop,
neither were her wings so wide.</p>

<p>12. It was a great job for her to keep the
large eggs under cover at all, but she shook
out her feathers and spread out her wings
as far as they would go, though it made
them ache.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>13. Then she felt nervous because the
pond was so near. "It is bad for eggs to
get damp!" she said to herself. "What
could make that foolish Snowdrop choose
such a place? And I dare say that I shall
get the cramp too."</p>

<p>14. But she sat on bravely for all that.
Betty never left the eggs of which she was
taking care, except for a few moments when
she was forced by hunger to run to the
yard.</p>

<p>15. The good farmer's wife saw her
racing there one day. She watched her
pick up some corn in a great hurry and
then rush off. She went after Betty and
saw her get into the nest of the duck, to
sit there after her hasty meal.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p><i>Write:</i> The hen wished to sit on the
eggs of the duck. She did not leave them
except to get food when she was hungry.

<blockquote><p>Questions: 1. What did Snowdrop make among the rushes?
2. How many eggs did she lay? 3. What did the hen offer to
do? 4. What did Snowdrop say? 5. How did Betty get food?
6. Who saw her running back to the eggs?</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>


<h3>10. THE WEE DUCKS.</h3>

<p>1. "Pretty dear!" said the farmer's
wife to Betty, as she saw her climb gently
on to the eggs and spread out her small
wings as far as she could.</p>

<p>2. "This will never do," she went on.
"If you want to hatch them, my pretty,
you had better do it in your own nest."</p>

<p>3. So she stooped down, stroked Betty's
white back softly, and then, with a firm,
gentle hand, pushed her aside while she
took all the seven eggs into her apron.</p>

<p>4. At first Betty did not like it. She
did not know what Snowdrop would say,
and besides, she had a longing inside her
to finish the job. She wanted to see the
dear little things come from the shells.</p>

<p>5. "I shall love them as my own," said
she, "unless the farmer's wife takes them
from me." But she was quite happy when
she saw the eggs placed safely in her own
snug dry nest.</p>

<p>6. Betty sat on the eggs for three long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
weeks. She knew that was the proper
time to wait for her own broods. But
still no sign of the young ones was to be
seen.</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 510px;">

<span class="caption">HER OWN SNUG NEST.</span>
</p>

<p>7. "I do believe that cold water has
killed them before they are born!" said
poor Betty, "for they never ought to have
been laid so near a pond."</p>

<p>8. She sat on and on, for a fourth week.
And, at the end of that time, she had her
reward. There was a little faint tapping
sound inside the shells.</p>

<p>9. The baby ducks were trying to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
out of prison. She helped them by picking
away bits of the shell as it broke, to let the
light in at their tiny windows.</p>

<p>10. At last seven little yellow things as
soft as satin cried, "peep, peep!" in a
pretty whisper round her feet. Their bills
and their feet were rather flat, it is true,
but what of that? Betty loved them as if
they were her own chicks.</p>

<p>11. "Of course I do not expect that they
will be quite so handsome, so clever, or so
good as if born from my own eggs," said
she.</p>

<p>12. "They will be poor weak little
things. I can see that they are rather
stupid, even now, from their staying in
the shells a week longer than they ought.</p>

<p>13. "But I must take a little extra care
with them!" Very proud was Mother
Betty, but in spite of all her fondness, the
young ducks gave her much trouble.</p>

<p>14. They would not come when they
were called. And they would play in the
gutter. They dabbled with their little
yellow feet in the black mud, as often as
ever they could.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>15. They liked digging in a dirty ditch
for worms better than feeding from a nice
clean plate. And they will gobble snails,
shells and all, no matter what Betty said.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

eggs were hatched. Betty found that the

How long did Betty sit on them? 4. Where did the young ducks
want to play? 5. What did they wish to eat? 6. Why did

<h3>11. AN AWKWARD LOT.</h3>

<p>1. But Betty was a hopeful hen. She
did not give up trying to teach the young
ducklings and bring them up well. She
kept them with great care from speaking
to any of their own kind.</p>

<p>2. She would not let them play with
other ducklings. They had never seen
that dreadful pond yet. She would not
let them waddle within sight of it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>3. As to their bad manners, their love
of dirt and snails and wet, she could only
think that it came from their having once
laid as eggs in that old straw cradle of theirs,
among the green rushes.</p>

<p>4. "Or else it is because their feet are
the wrong shape," said Betty, as she looked
down at the yellow boots of her foster-sons
and daughters. On the whole they did
not behave so very badly, she thought.</p>

<p>5. They came up with the chickens at
meal times, even if they did go straight
back to that vile gutter the moment they
had gobbled all they could get.</p>

<p>6. "What a clever hen is Betty Dorking!"
the others said. "She has brought
up the duck's brood and will make chickens
of them!" It is true that the wise old
gander laughed at this notion.</p>

<p>7. He said, "You never see a silk purse
made out of any other thing but silk," and
all his wives nodded their heads and
cackled. They said it was witty, though
they had no idea what the speech meant.</p>

<p>8. As the golden ears were taken by
heaps into the rick-yard, the birds felt as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
glad as the farmer and his wife did. The
great sheaves were stacked and the fowls
gleaned after them.</p>

<p>9. Betty, as well as the rest, picked up
plenty of loose grains. There was a little
squabbling once, and the turkey-cock trod
on one of Betty's ducklings.</p>

<p>10. The great bird said nothing but
"gobble gobble!" and did not even show
that he was sorry. The peacock was not
too proud to come walking in among the
rest, in a dainty way, holding up his train.</p>

<p>11. He liked wheat as much as any of
them. But he could not bear soiling his
dress. Betty now thought it was time to
take her foster-children into the world,
before winter came.</p>

<p>12. They were grown to a fair size, and
as yet no cold water had ever come near
them, except a few splashes, which their
nurse could not prevent.</p>

<p>13. After a good deal of driving and
shrieking to them, she got her brood into
a small crowd, to see if they were neat.
She smoothed their downy heads, she
plumed their soft wings with loving care.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>14. Then she said, "My dears, you are
all as tidy as you can be made. I am now
going to take you on a visit to your own
mother, whom you have never yet seen.</p>

<p>15. "Behave well, and give me no
cause to feel shame when she sees how I
have brought you up. Now, Forward!
March!"</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p><i>Write:</i> The young ducks had never
seen a pond. Their foster-mother made
them tidy. She wished to take them into
the world and show them their mother.</p>

<blockquote><p>Questions: 1. What did the other hens say of Betty and her
brood? 2. What did the gander say? 3. What bird came to
pick up wheat with the fowls? 4. What did the turkey-cock
do? 5. What did Betty say to her ducklings before taking them
into the world? 6. To whom did she wish to show them?</p></blockquote>


<h3>12. THEIR OWN MOTHER.</h3>

<p>1. And where was Snowdrop to be
found? At the pond, of course, swimming
round and round with half-a-dozen other
ducks and drakes as happy and careless as
herself.</p>

<p>2. She swam towards the brink when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
she saw Betty coming. The ducklings
waddled as fast as they could lay their flat
feet to the ground, as soon as they caught
sight of the pond.</p>

<img src="images/image033.png" width="383" height="450" alt="THE FIRST SWIM." title="THE FIRST SWIM." />
<span class="caption">THE FIRST SWIM.</span>
</p>

<p>3. Betty could not keep up with them,
for she had never quite lost a limp, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
having her toe bitten off. "See," she said
to Snowdrop, as she hobbled up, "here are
your children.</p>

<p>4. "Look at them well! How unlike
they are to any ducklings you ever brought
up yourself! There are no ducks in the
whole yard that can compare with them.
Just watch how well they behave."</p>

<p>5. "Quack!" said Snowdrop.
"It is all because of the pains I have
taken," said Betty.</p>

<p>"Quack, quack!" said Snowdrop again.</p>

<p>6. "They have never been tempted to
go into horrid cold water. They have never
even seen a pond till now. What do you
say to that?"</p>

<p>7. "Quack, quack, quack!" replied the
snowy sailor, glancing her bright eye upon
her little ones. The next moment the
merry little ducks were sailing after her
round the pond!</p>

<p>8. They dived head foremost, they
grubbed for leeches, they paddled with
their flat feet as if they had done nothing
else since they were out of the shell.</p>

<p>9. Poor Betty with outspread wings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
danced round the pond crying at the
top of her shrill voice, "Come back! come
back! You will all be drowned."</p>

<p>10. But it was useless. The little ducks
would obey her no longer. They went on
swimming about after their own lily-white
mother.</p>

<p>11. Snowdrop swam to the edge at last,
and spoke thus to Betty. "I thank you
for the good you meant to me and mine.
But dry land will not give us your sharp
toes to scratch with, any sooner than water
will give you web-feet to swim with.</p>

<p>12. "All that you have taught my children
on dry land, I shall be pleased to repay by
teaching the next brood you have to swim
and dive." At this the gander stretched
out his throat and laughed.</p>

<p>13. "You should allow yourself more time
to think," said old Dame Turkey, the wife
of the turkey-cock, as she stood on one
leg to listen.</p>

<p>14. "You are always in a hurry and a
bustle. Don't mind so much about the
affairs of other people, and take things
calmly, as I do. If you had been more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
like me, you would not have made this
mistake about the duck."</p>

<p>15. "We have not all the same habits,&mdash;the
same nature," said Mistress Betty,
softly. "And I see that it is of no use
trying to make other folks' children like
our own." Dame Turkey nodded her head
in a very wise manner.</p>

<p>16. She must have been a very clever
old dame, for she knew when to keep
silent. As for Betty, she grew to be a very
modest, useful hen, with no pride or conceit
about her.</p>

<p>17. At the present time, though she is
getting old, she is still a worthy fowl.
She lives at the same farm, and would
divide her last worm with a chicken or a
friend. But she has never tried to turn
ducklings into chicks again.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p><i>Write:</i> The little ducks saw the pond.
They ran to it and went in. It was of no
use for the hen to call them back. They
went after their own mother-duck.</p>

<blockquote><p>Questions: 1. Where was Snowdrop to be found? 2. What
did the ducklings do when they saw the pond? 3. What did the
guinea-hen call out? 4. What did Betty do? 5. What did Dame
Turkey say? 6. What sort of hen did Betty become?</p></blockquote>
